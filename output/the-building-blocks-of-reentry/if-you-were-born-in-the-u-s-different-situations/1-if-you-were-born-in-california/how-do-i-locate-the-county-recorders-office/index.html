        <p class="text">Whether you plan to make your request in person or by mail, you first need to locate the Recorder’s Office in the county in which you were born. The CDPH provides a statewide directory of County Recorder’s Offices (addresses, phone numbers, and websites). To get the address and phone number for the County Recorder’s Office, call CDPH Customer Service at 1-916-445-2684 or visit the website at: <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/">http://www.cdph.ca.gov/</a> and search for “birth certificates.”<sup><a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> You can also use Directory Assistance to locate the address by dialing 4-1-1 from any phone, but this service charges a fee (as much as $1.99 per 4-1-1 call).<sup><a href="#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27">[27]</a></sup></p>
