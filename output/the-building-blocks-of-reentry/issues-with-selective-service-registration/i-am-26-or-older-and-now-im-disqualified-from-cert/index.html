To do this, you must fill out a form requesting a “Status Information Letter” from the Selective Service System. (See Appendix L, PG. 120.) You will have to list the dates during which you were incarcerated, and attach any documents that show when and where you were incarcerated. If you can prove that you were incarcerated during the relevant time, the Selective Service System will send you an official letter stating that you <em>were not required to register</em>. If you show this letter to the benefit-issuing agency to which you are applying, it can’t legally deny you benefits because of your Selective Service status.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">. . .
