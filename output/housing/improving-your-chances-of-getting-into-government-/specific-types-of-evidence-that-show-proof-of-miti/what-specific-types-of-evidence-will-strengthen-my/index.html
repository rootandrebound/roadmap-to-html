          <h3><a id="_Toc448153161"></a>What specific types of evidence will strengthen my housing application to government-assisted housing?</h3>
          <p class="text">Provide proof of your rehabilitation and mitigating factors as explained above! Letters of support and certificates of successful completion of programs that improved your life are one of the key ways can help strengthen your application to government-assisted housing!</p>
          <p class="text">Make sure that the letters you get are detailed and really, really positive about you! A weak, impersonal letter is almost as useless as no letter at all. </p>
          <p><strong><em>Below are some places you should consider getting letters of support or other documents proving your participation:</em></strong></p>
          <h4 class="subheading3">evidence from SCHOOL: </h4>
          <p class="text">Show that you stayed in school for at least 6 months and have a positive school record.</p>
          <ol class="text">Proof could be in a transcript with good grades, or a letter from a teacher or school administrator.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Our suggestion: If school administrators or teachers can say the following things truthfully, these letters should say that you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Were in school for at least six months; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Had great attendance and punctuality; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Had excellent grades; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Are motivated to learn and get ahead in life.  </ol>
          <h4 class="subheading3">evidence from JOB TRAINING programs:</h4>
          <p class="text">Show that you stayed in a job-training program for at least 6 months and have a positive record. </p>
          <ol class="text">Proof could be through a letter from a program supervisor or administrator. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Our suggestion: If true, ask your teacher or the program administrator to say that you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Participated for at least six months;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Had great attendance and punctuality;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Are motivated to learn and get ahead in life;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Have learned useful skills to apply to a job; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Get along well with others. </ol>
          <h4 class="subheading3">evidence of EMPLOYMENT: </h4>
          <p class="text">Show that you kept a job for at least 6 months and had a positive work record:</p>
          <ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from a supervisor or other person at the job. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Our suggestion: These letters should not just state how long you have worked. If possible, they should also say:</ol>
          <ol class="text">How well you have performed your job;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Whether you have been promoted;</ol>
          <ol class="text">That you have an excellent attendance record and come to work on time; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">That you are motivated, responsible, and get along well with others.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you worked while you were incarcerated and can get a good letter from a supervisor, do it! This can be useful, especially if you went above and beyond what was required by the job.  </ol>
          <h4 class="subheading3">evidence of your participation in COUNSELING OR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMs:</h4>
          <p class="text">Show that you spent at least 6 months in counseling or another social service program to deal with the problem that led you into criminal behavior. If you were in drug treatment or had a drug problem, you might be required to provide a clean drug test. You also have to show that you have done well in the program.</p>
          <ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from your counselor, therapist, or doctor.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Our suggestion: These letters should do a lot more than simply state the dates you were in treatment and the fact that you completed treatment. If your counselors in social service, mental health, and/or alcohol and drug programs can say the following things truthfully, then they should also say that you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Had great attendance;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Had clear drug tests for at least 12 months (and provide the test results);</ol>
          <ol class="text">Showed excellent motivation and desire to change;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Participated fully in programs;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Got along well with others;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Understand the causes of your past behaviors and are committed to positive growth;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Are not a risk to the safety of others; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">No longer hang out with the same peers that got you into trouble. </ol>
          <h4 class="subheading3">PROOF OF a DISABILITY: </h4>
          <p class="text">If you have any type of disability that prevents you from going to school or working, then it can help to show any programs you have participated in to get support for your disability. If the disability is a past drug addiction (NOT a current one), alcoholism, or a mental health issue, it could be helpful to show at least six months of counseling, such as mental health treatment or drug or alcohol treatment.</p>
          <p class="text">Proof of this can be your counselor’s letter explaining that you are unable to work (see above). You can also try to get any other proof of your disability, such as a letter from your doctor, saying that you cannot work or go to school because of your disability. If you are on SSI or SSDI public benefits, you can also provide proof (learn more about SSI on PG. 604, and more about SSDI on PG. 581 in the PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER). If you cannot show at least six months of counseling, work, school, or job training, then you will have a much harder time convincing the PHA to find you eligible. However, if your disability is so severe that you cannot participate in ANY of these activities (for example, you are homebound), a letter explaining this can be helpful. </p>
          <h4 class="subheading3">Proof of expungement, dismissal, pardon, or CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION for a past conviction:</h4>
          <p><strong>For more information about whether you qualify for some form of expungement (like a dismissal, pardon, or Certificate of Rehabilitation), and how to get these, go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132.</strong></p>
          <h4 class="subheading3">OTHER HELPFUL EVIDENCE:</h4>
          <p class="text">While PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are not as persuaded by the following types of evidence, they can still be helpful if the support letters are very detailed, very positive, and make you look like you are doing ALL YOU CAN DO to move your life in a positive direction and be a productive member of society. Consider the following other forms of helpful evidence to include in your application to government-assisted housing (OR at a hearing challenging a denial):</p>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Certificates from programs in or after prison</strong>, like anger management and drug or alcohol treatment. Remember that any programs in prison count!</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letter from your Parole or Probation Officer</strong>: Our suggestion—If your Probation or Parole Officer can say the following things truthfully, ask him/her to comment on your:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Positive drug tests for at least 12 months;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Positive outlook;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Compliance with all the requirements of parole or probation; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Exceptional motivation.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letters from clergy</strong>: Our suggestion—These letters are most helpful if they show that you volunteer and play a leadership role in your community.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letters from landlords or building superintendents</strong>. Our suggestion—Ask them to say that you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Always paid your rent on time;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Respected your neighbors; and </ol>
          <ol class="text">Treated the property well.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letters from neighbors</strong>: Our suggestion—They should discuss what a good neighbor you are—for example, that you are quiet, respectful, and/or helpful to the building or community. </ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letters from your volunteer work</strong>: Our suggestion—Have you helped out at your children’s school? At their daycare center? Have you been a mentor to a child? Helped a senior citizen? Volunteered in any other way? Get a letter saying that you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Are responsible;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Have made a major contribution; and/or </ol>
          <ol class="text">Are dedicated to your volunteer work.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Also get a letter from anyone you have helped. Have them say what an important role you played for them. Ask the person to be specific!</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Letters from people you have helped</strong>: Our suggestion—It can be very moving to read a letter from someone whose life you have touched in a positive way. Have you helped someone through your church? In your neighborhood? Through work?</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Proof about your children’s successes</strong>: Our suggestion—If your children have done impressive things, highlight that your parenting had something to do with it. Examples of what you might give are:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Letter from your child’s teacher about his/her great work or good grades, emphasizing your role in encouraging your child to do his/her best, making sure your child does his/her homework, etc.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Letter from your child’s coach in sports—similar to the letter from a teacher.</ol>
          <h5 class="question">What about getting support letters from family? </h5>
          <p class="text">While it is always nice to have support from your family, these letters are not as helpful because the PHA and/or owner of government-assisted housing assumes that your family members would write anything to help you get the housing. You can certainly include such letters if you like, but letters from people outside your family will have a bigger impact. </p>
