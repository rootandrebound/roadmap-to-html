        <h1>Can I apply for VA benefits while incarcerated?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861628"></a>Can I apply for VA benefits while incarcerated?</h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. Although your eligibility for VA benefits may be limited or cut off during incarceration, there are various VA benefits you can apply for while incarcerated. There are certain benefits you can apply for and receive in full while incarcerated; and there are certain other benefits you should start applying for while incarcerated so that you can access them immediately upon your release. Information about some of these benefits is provided below. Contact the VA at 1-800-827-1000 (TDD 1-800-829-4833) for further details.</p>

        <h4 class="sidebox">compensation and pension examination?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Even if you are incarcerated, the VA is obligated to provide you with a compensation and pension eamination when one is required (see VA Fast Letter 11-22, Examinations for Incarcerated Veterans and Veterans Health Administration (Sept. 8, 2011)). You have the right to have a medical professional perform the examination at the facility where you are incarcerated (see Bolton v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 185 (1995).</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>Meet with your region’s Re-entry Specialist.</em> Every region of the U.S. has a VA Re-entry Specialist who can help determine your eligibility for VA benefits. He/she can also help you enroll, restart disability benefits, getting your DD-214 (explained below), and connecting you with services. Your region’s Re-entry Specialist should be scheduled to visit your facility at least yearly.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Enroll with the VA. </em>Do this by visiting with a Re-entry Specialist, OR by submitting a VA Form 10-10EZ by mail (see copy of form in Appendix L, PG. 536). If your release date is within 6 months and you haven’t seen a Re-entry Specialist, enroll by mail to ensure timely access to services. To request a form, write to a VA Enrollment Office near your place of release (directory online at <a href="http://www.va.gov/directory/guide">http://www.va.gov/directory/guide</a>), and mail back your completed form with “VA Enrollment” written on the envelope.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Get a copy of your “DD-214: Report of Separation.”</em> Have this ready before release. This is your proof of military service, and it’s a key to your access to job opportunities, community resources, and health care. To request your DD-214, write to: National Personnel Records Center; 1 Archives Drive; St. Louis, MO 63136.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>File for service-related</em> <em>disability compensation or disability pension, if that applies to you.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1779" id="footnote-ref-1779">[1778]</a></sup></ol>
