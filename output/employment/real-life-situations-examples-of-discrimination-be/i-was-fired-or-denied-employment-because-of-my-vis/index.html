        <h1>I was fired or denied employment because of my visible tattoos. Do I have any legal protections against discrimination?</h1>
        <p class="text">Most likely, no. There are no legal protections from employment discrimination based on an employee’s visible tattoos. Both California state and federal employment discrimination laws specify certain “protected classes” such as gender, religion, race, and sexual orientation. Neither California nor federal law, however, protect against discrimination based on an applicant’s visible tattoos. Therefore, employers can legally deny you employment based on your tattoos.</p>
        <p class="text">HOWEVER, there have been cases of people bringing employment discrimination claims involving tattoos, when they are protected by one of the specified classes. For example, courts have found protections for religious tattoos, as “religion” is a protected class.<sup><a href="#footnote-1962" id="footnote-ref-1962">[1961]</a></sup> Plaintiffs have also been successful bringing claims based on gender discrimination, when employers take adverse action against men with tattoos, but not women.<sup><a href="#footnote-1963" id="footnote-ref-1963">[1962]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">A Summary of Your Rights</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">An employer CANNOT discriminate against you based on your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT weigh your criminal history more heavily than another applicant’s similar criminal history because of your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT deny employment to everyone with a criminal history.An employer, however, CAN justify a hiring policy against people with criminal histories if it shows the policy is “job related” and “consistent with business necessity.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1964" id="footnote-ref-1964">[1963]</a></sup> An employer SHOULD evaluate your individual circumstances and consider: Facts and circumstances surrounding your offense;The number of convictions in your history;Your age at the time of conviction / release;If you have held the same type of job, post-conviction, without incidents;Your employment history before and after conviction;Your rehabilitation efforts;Employment or character references; andWhether you are bonded.<sup><a href="#footnote-1965" id="footnote-ref-1965">[1964]</a></sup>An employer SHOULD give you notice that you were denied employment because of your criminal history, and give you a chance to show that it should make an exception for you based on your individual circumstances.</ul>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861716"></a>What can I do if I feel I was illegally discriminated against by an employer? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you think that an employer has illegally discriminated against you either because of a complete ban against people with criminal records or by treating your record negatively because of your race, sex, religion, or national origin, etc., you can report the employer to the EEOC or DFEH. (The EEOC and DFEH are the government agencies responsible for enforcing certain civil rights and anti-discrimination laws.)</p>
        <p class="text">You may want to talk to a legal aid lawyer or plaintiff’s-side employment layer about your situation. You have to file a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH before you are allowed to file a lawsuit in court against the employer, and a lawyer can help you with this process. IT is recommended you contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately, and reach out to lawyers who can advise you. For more information about finding a lawyer, see PG. 594. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 590.</p>
