        <h1>How do I present my best self to an employer?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153391"></a>How do I present my best self to an employer?</h3>
        <p class="textbox">While you can’t control everything about the job search, there are MANY steps you can and should take to improve your chances of being hired for the job you want—whether that means cleaning up your record, finishing school, or learning new skills and getting more experience. This section will explain what you can do <em>before</em> you begin applying for jobs, <em>throughout</em> your job search, and <em>during </em>your application process, to help improve your chances of being hired.</p>
        <ol class="text">BEFORE you begin applying for jobs:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Beef up your resume before any new job application</ol>
        <ol class="text">Clean up your record</ol>
        <ol class="text">THROUGHOUT your job search:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Target your job search for jobs that are an appropriate fit for you</ol>
        <ol class="text">WHILE APPLYING for jobs:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Ace the job application</ol>
        <ol class="text">Interview well</ol>
        <ol class="text">Understand and explain the benefits to the employer</ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">Tattoo REMOVAL:My visible tattoos are preventing me from obtaining employment and moving on with my life after incarceration. I’d like them removed. Is there anyone who can help?</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">Yes. If you are interested in removing your tattoos, there are several organizations in California that offer free or low-cost tattoo removal for people who are having trouble obtaining employment due to visible tattoos, particularly if they are gang-related tattoos. <strong>Homeboy Industries</strong> in Los Angeles, for example, offers free tattoo removal and a number of other useful services for formerly incarcerated people. Upon your release, you can search for more organizations that provide these services at http://jailstojobs.org/wordpress/tattoo-removal. For a list of places that offer low-cost tattoo removal in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, see APPENDIX [] on PG. X. </ul>
        <h4 class="sidebox">VOLUNTEERING</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Consider volunteering with local religious or community organizations, and plan to stick around for at least 6 months. The length of time you remain dedicated to the organization is more important than the amount of time you spend volunteering during a particular day or week. Your volunteer work can help to calm an employer’s concerns about your past, and strong references can go a very long way in helping to secure a future paying position.<strong> </strong></p>
