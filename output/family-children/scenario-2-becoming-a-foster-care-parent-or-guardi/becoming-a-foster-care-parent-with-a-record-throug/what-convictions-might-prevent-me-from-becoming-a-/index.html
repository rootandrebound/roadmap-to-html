        <p class="text">If you have a criminal conviction on your record, you may still be able to become a foster parent if you apply for an “exemption.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2407" id="footnote-ref-2407">[2375]</a></sup></sup> When reviewing your application for an exemption, the California Department of Social Services will asses whether you have good character and are rehabilitated. The following factors will be considered when making that determination:</p>
        <ol class="text">The nature of the crime. 	</ol>
        <ol class="text">Period of time since the crime was committed and number of offenses. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime that would demonstrate that repetition is not likely. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Activities since conviction, including employment or participation in therapy or education, that would indicate changed behavior. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Granting by the Governor of a full and unconditional pardon. For more information on a pardon from the Governor, see PG. 1188 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Character references. </ol>
        <ol class="text">A certificate of rehabilitation from a superior court. For more information on how to get a certificate of rehabilitation and what it means, see PG 1184 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER.</ol>
        <ol class="text"> Evidence of honesty and truthfulness as revealed in exemption application documents and interviews.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Documents include, but are not limited to:</ol>
        <ol class="text">A Criminal Record Statement (LIC 508D, Criminal Record Statement); and</ol>
        <ol class="text">The person's written statement/explanation of the conviction and the circumstances surrounding the arrest. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Evidence of honesty and truthfulness as revealed in exemption application interviews and conversations between the person or others and the Department.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2408" id="footnote-ref-2408">[2376]</a></sup></sup></ol>
