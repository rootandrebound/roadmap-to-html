        <h3><a id="_Toc352861872"></a>If I have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of my child, what are my legal rights as a parent?</h3>
        <p class="text">Guardianship does NOT end your parental rights; it puts them on hold while the guardian has the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2382" id="footnote-ref-2382">[2381]</a></sup> </sup>This allows the guardian(s) to make all the decisions about caring for the child that a parent would make, without permanently cutting off the parents’ rights to ask for custody of their child back in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2383" id="footnote-ref-2383">[2382]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Parent’s Rights:</strong> The child’s legal or biological parents still have certain <em>rights</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
        <ol class="text">The children in a guardianship are still considered legally and biologically “related” to their parents (the parents’ rights are not terminated);</ol>
        <ol class="text">The judge or the guardian of the child can allow the parents or other relatives to visit with the children in a guardianship;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2384" id="footnote-ref-2384">[2383]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">When the judge appoints a guardian to have custody of a child, the judge may also give visitation rights to the child’s parent(s) and/or sibling(s) to visit the child.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If the judge orders visitation, the child’s guardian must allow these visits to take place. </ol>
        <ol class="text">If there is no court order for visitation, the guardian has the right to decide whether the child may visit with his/her parent(s) or other relatives.<strong> </strong>So if you don't have a court order and the guardian is not letting you see your child, you might need to go to Probate Court to ask the judge for visitation. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Please Note:</em> You will need to ask for visitation from <em>the same probate court</em> that appointed your child’s current guardian, which may be in a different county from where you live. You will also need to use that county’s own specific probate court forms to request visitation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2385" id="footnote-ref-2385">[2384]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <p class="text"><strong>Parent’s Responsibilities:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">The child’s legal or biological parents also still have certain <em>responsibilities</em> for their child during the guardianship. Parents must continue to financially support their children in a guardianship (including paying child support if it’s ordered – read more about child support on PG. 770. Also, children in a guardianship can inherit money or get Social Security benefits from their parents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2386" id="footnote-ref-2386">[2385]</a></sup></sup> If you are currently or about to become incarcerated and would like to learn how to pause your child support payments, see PG. 772 in the “Child Support” section.</p>
