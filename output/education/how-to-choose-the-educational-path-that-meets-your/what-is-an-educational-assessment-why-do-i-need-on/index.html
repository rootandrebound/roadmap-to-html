        <p class="text">If you’re not sure how far you got in school, or it’s been so long that you’re not sure what your current education level is, your first step is to get an “educational assessment.” An educational assessment is simply a way to find out what your current ability level is in English, reading, writing and math. </p>

        <p class="text">It is important to get an educational assessment before you start any educational program so that you don’t waste time re-learning things you already know or taking classes for which you are not prepared. </p>
