<h3><a id="_Toc448153806"></a>What is a bachelor’s degree? How can it help me? </h3>

<p class="text">Bachelor’s degrees are offered by four-year colleges and universities. Bachelor’s degree programs are designed to take four years of full-time study to complete, however, many students choose to complete them in five years, and part-time students may take even longer. Students are required to take a variety of general education courses, plus several courses in a specific area of study called a major, that the student chooses. A bachelor’s degree can be a stepping-stone toward earning a graduate or professional degree, and is required for many high-salary, high-status jobs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2801" id="footnote-ref-2801">[2768]</a></sup></p>

  <p>
    What types of Bachelor’s degrees are there?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two main kinds of Bachelor’s degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees and Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees.[2769] BAs are awarded for programs of study that focus on areas within the liberal arts, humanities, or social studies (such as English, Psychology, or History). BSs are awarded for programs of study that focus on areas within the “hard” sciences, such as Math, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics.[2770]

  <p>
    How much will it cost to earn a Bachelor’s degree?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bachelor’s degrees from four-year colleges and universities are expensive. They can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most people require financial assistance from federal or state student aid programs, or from private organizations to pay their tuition. (For information on Paying for College, see PG. 1082.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE ON PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE SCHOOLS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Both public and private colleges and universities offer Bachelor’s degree programs. Public schools are partially funded by government taxes and usually charge lower tuition (especially for in-state residents). They tend to have a larger student population and larger class sizes. Private schools are generally more expensive, and tend to focus on keeping classes small and exposing students to many different subjects. [2771]NOTE ABOUT IN-STATE TUITION: Most schools require that you have lived in California for a certain period of time in order to get the discounted “resident” or “in-state” tuition rate. [2772] Some schools will consider time that you spent incarcerated in California towards this requirement. Check with your school’s admissions and financial aid offices to find out if your period of incarceration qualifies you as a California resident under that school’s policy. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I find a Bachelor’s degree program? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Earn college credits. Unfortunately, at the time of this publication, there currently are no four-year Bachelor’s degree programs offered in federal, state, or county correctional facilities in California, and correspondence courses that advertise four-year degrees should not be trusted. However, you can earn college credits while you are incarcerated which can be applied toward a four-year degree after you are released. (For information on how to earn college credits while you are incarcerated, see Associate Degree Programs, PG. 1068, and Distance Education, PG. 1076. For information on how to transfer college credits that you earn while you are incarcerated, see PG. 1076. For information on how to tell if a school or program is a scam, see PG. 1043.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Plan and Prepare. There is plenty you can do to plan and prepare for your post-release education while you are still incarcerated. You can research schools (see PG. 1062), complete applications (see PG. 1052), take placement tests (see PG. 1048), and apply for financial aid (see PG. 1082)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit your public library and ask the librarian to show you to the section on college guides.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Search colleges and universities on the Internet. You can search based on location, cost, program or degree options, or rankings.

    College Resources for People in Reentry
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Project Rebound is an academic support program that helps currently and formerly incarcerated people enroll and stay in college. Originally founded at San Francisco State University, it has since expanded to eight California State University campuses.[2773] Project Rebound answers letters from people incarcerated across California and helps them apply to college before they’re released. Once people enroll in college, Project Rebound connects them to supportive resources on campus and in the community.[2774]
