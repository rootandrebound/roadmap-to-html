          <p class="text">If you are ready for (or already taking) high school-level classes, your next step is to earn your high school degree. As an adult student, your high school degree can be a stepping-stone to a “higher education” degree (see PG. 1062) or a better job, or simply an important personal achievement. This chapter will explain how you can earn your high school degree. </p>
