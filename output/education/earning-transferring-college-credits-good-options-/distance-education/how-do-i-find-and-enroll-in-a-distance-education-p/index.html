        <ol class="text">Ask your Correctional Counselor, or the staff of your facility’s education department for information on available programs (Note: Because of the technology requirements of Distance Education programs, they may not be available at your facility); </ol>

        <h4 class="textbox">ACCREDITATION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS</h4>
        <p class="textbox">There are numerous commercial websites that advertise hundreds of Distance Education programs and schools in the U.S. and abroad. However, keep in mind that schools and programs pay to be listed on these websites. This means that when you search these sites, only those that have paid will come up—you will not see the rest of the schools and programs out there, so the results of your search will be limited. Also, many of these websites claim that they only list “accredited” schools and programs, however, you should always do your own research to make sure that a school or Distance Education program is 1) legitimate and 2) recognized by an approved accrediting agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2832" id="footnote-ref-2832">[2799]</a></sup> (For more information on accreditation and scam programs, see <em>Choosing Your Educational Path</em>, PG. 1043.)</p>
