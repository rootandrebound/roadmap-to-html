        <h3><a id="_Toc448153083"></a>Where are the revocation hearings held?</h3>
        <p>The revocation hearing will be either (1) an institutional hearing OR (2) a local hearing.</p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>INSTITUTIONAL HEARINGS: Generally, revocation hearings are held after you are returned to a federal institution. An institutional hearing is held within 90 days from time you were taken into custody on the U.S. Parole Commission’s warrant.</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">LOCAL HEARINGS: If there are sufficient reasons to do so, the U.S. Parole Commission may order your revocation hearing held in your own community or in the community where you were arrested. <em>You only have the right to a local hearing if:</em> (1) You deny violating the conditions of your release, AND (2) You were NOT convicted of a new crime. </p>
        <p class="text">If a local revocation hearing is requested, the you must complete a request form. There is a penalty for false answers on this form. Local revocation hearings are generally held within 60 days from the date the Regional Commissioner finds “probable cause” that parole or mandatory release was violated.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1005" id="footnote-ref-1005">[979]</a></sup></sup> If granted, your local revocation hearing will be scheduled to happen reasonably near the place of the alleged violation(s) or arrest.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>A NOTE ABOUT GETTING SUPPORT FROM A LAWYER:</em> At a local revocation hearing, you are more likely to have a lawyer and you can request that all adverse witnesses be called so you can confront and cross-examine them. In order to get a local revocation hearing, you and your attorney must (1) deny all the charges and (2) request a local revocation hearing. </p>
