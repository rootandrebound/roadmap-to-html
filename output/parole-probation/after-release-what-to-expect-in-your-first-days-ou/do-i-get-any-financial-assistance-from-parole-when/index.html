        <h1>Do I get any financial assistance from parole when I first get out?</h1>
        <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “INTEREST”?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Interest is a small percentage of your money that is held in your account. Periodically, interest gets added to your account, due to the fact that someone else (the prison) is holding your money.</p>
        <p class="text">Yes, but it is <em>very limited </em>and for a very small amount. You are entitled to the money in your trust account and to gate money. You may be able to get other emergency funds by requesting them through your parole agent. Below, we explain which types of financial assistance you can ask for during your first days out:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>(1) TRUST ACCOUNTS:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">Money that you brought to prison, earned in prison, or received in prison is kept in an interest-bearing trust account. The “interest” is paid to the trust account on a monthly basis, minus “operational expenses” (fees charged for operating the account). Any money in your trust account, including any interest earned, must be given to you at your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-344" id="footnote-ref-344">[343]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">I WAS IN CDCR’s CUSTODY FOR LESS THAN 6 MONTHS DUE TO A PAROLE VIOLATION. DO I GET GATE MONEY WHEN I AM RELEASED?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you were returned to prison or jail on a parole violation — but you were there for less than 6 months — you should receive $1.10 for each day you were held, up to a maximum of $200. (<em>See</em> 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3075.2(d)(4).)</p>
        <p class="text"><a id="PP_StateParole_GateMoney"></a><strong>(2) GATE MONEY (a.k.a. “RELEASE ALLOWANCE”):</strong></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>YOU GET $200 GATE MONEY IF:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you are leaving a California state prison and you are (1) paroled, (2) placed on post-release community supervision (PRCS), or (3) discharged from a CDCR institution or reentry facility, you are entitled to $200 in state funds upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-345" id="footnote-ref-345">[344]</a></sup> Even though your parole agent is responsible for giving you these funds, the agent is not required to give you the entire amount immediately. Instead, your parole agent may distribute the $200 in separate, smaller amounts over a period of 60 days following your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-346" id="footnote-ref-346">[345]</a></sup> By the end of those 60 days, you should have received the entire $200. If you need to buy clothes or a bus ticket at the time of your release, you must pay for it; CDCR does not provide extra gate money for clothing or transportation. If you ask CDCR to help cover these costs, it will deduct the amount from your $200 gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-347" id="footnote-ref-347">[346]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You also have the right to the $200 gate money in the following cases:</p>
        <ul class="importantbox">If you were sent to a local jail for civil commitment proceedings or evaluation as a “sexually violent predator” (SVP).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-348" id="footnote-ref-348">[347]</a></sup></strong>If you are a “lifer parolee” who returned to prison on a parole violation, and you are being re-released to parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-349" id="footnote-ref-349">[348]</a></sup></strong>If you served 6 straight months or more, either on a sentence OR on a return-to-custody for a parole violation (these 6 months could be time in jail or in prison).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-350" id="footnote-ref-350">[349]</a></sup></strong><em>If you do not receive your gate money in one of these situations (which is common), file an administrative appeal. Ask your jail or parole agent for the proper forms (see </em>PG. 173<em> for a detailed discussion of the 602 appeals process)</em>.</ul>
        <p class="text"><strong>YOU GET $100 GATE MONEY IF YOU RECEIVED A $100 ADVANCE:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you are released from prison into a Community Correctional Reentry Facility<sup><a href="#footnote-351" id="footnote-ref-351">[350]</a></sup> or Alternative Custody Program (ACP),<sup><a href="#footnote-352" id="footnote-ref-352">[351]</a></sup> you may be given an advance of up to $100 of your gate money at that time.<sup><a href="#footnote-353" id="footnote-ref-353">[352]</a></sup> Once you are released from the reentry facility or ACP, you may receive only what is left of the $200 — for most, this will be $100 that has not yet been given to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-354" id="footnote-ref-354">[353]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>YOU WILL <em>NOT</em> RECEIVE YOUR GATE MONEY IF YOU ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON INTO THE CUSTODY OF ANOTHER AGENCY THAT IS DETAINING YOU:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you are released from a state prison into the custody of another state prison, a federal prison, or a county jail, you will not get gate money until you are released from that custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-355" id="footnote-ref-355">[354]</a></sup> (This might happen if you face charges or have been convicted in another state or in the federal system.) Similarly, if you are released from prison into the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and are waiting for a deportation hearing date, you will not get gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-356" id="footnote-ref-356">[355]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you “abscond” from parole before receiving all of your gate money, you give up your right to the gate money. This means if you flee, go missing, fail to report to your parole agent, or fail to let your parole agent know where you are, you lose your right to the $200 gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-357" id="footnote-ref-357">[356]</a></sup> If you abscond from parole, you also risk: 1) getting your parole revoked and going back to prison; 2) being held on parole for a longer time period than originally required; 3) being forced to wear a GPS tracking advice while on parole (see PG. 157). </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you were put in jail for parole revocation proceedings, you do not receive gate money upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-358" id="footnote-ref-358">[357]</a></sup></p>
        <h5 class="question">What can I do if I don’t get my gate money?</h5>
        <p class="text">Your parole officer should give you gate money at your release. If, however, your officer does not have the money or does not know where to send it, you should file an administrative appeal (CDCR Form 602 and CDCR Form 22) and start the grievance process. We recommend keeping copies and dates of any appeals or grievance forms you submit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-359" id="footnote-ref-359">[358]</a></sup></sup> If you are in special proceedings — like MDO (mentally disordered offender) or SVP (sexually violent predator) hearings — getting gate money may be more complicated. If that is the case, you can call Root &amp; Rebound’s Reentry Legal Hotline at 510-279-4662 (Fridays, 9 am – 5 pm PST) for assistance. You may have to file an administrataive appeal (learn how on PG. 173.); or you could ask your public defender or defense attorney to file a motion on your behalf with the court to recover your gate money. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>(3) EMERGENCY FUNDS:</strong></p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT STOPS THE CLOCK FOR MY LENGTH OF TIME ON PAROLE?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The clock for your parole period is paused if:(1) YOU GO MISSING: Any time you “abscond” from parole (go missing or fail to report to your parole agent), and any time you are not available for parole supervision, this “stops the clock” and does not count toward the parole period. (2) YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR (SVP) PROCEEDINGS: The parole term is “tolled” (paused) until the SVP proceedings are dismissed or you are discharged from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH).(3) YOU ARE SENT TO COUNTY JAIL (NOT PRISON) FOR A NEW FELONY CONVICTION. If you are sentenced to a county jail term for a new felony conviction, you will stay on parole while serving your jail sentence, but the clock will pause on your parole term. If the jail sentence ends before your controlling discharge date (CDD) (see chart on PG. 149), you must report to your parole officer upon release and finish serving your original parole term. But if you are sentenced for a new felony conviction, your parole will just be forgotten about — it isn’t paused, but it no longer matters. </p>
        <p class="text">There are 2 types of emergency funds<sup><a href="#footnote-360" id="footnote-ref-360">[359]</a></sup> that you can request through your parole agent: (1) cash assistance loans (also called “financial assistance funds”)<sup><a href="#footnote-361" id="footnote-ref-361">[360]</a></sup> and (2) funds for services (also called “bank drafts”).<sup><a href="#footnote-362" id="footnote-ref-362">[361]</a></sup> Unfortunately, since budgets are tight, these funds are extremely limited.</p>
        <p class="text">These funds are <em>discretionary</em>. This means that your parole agent and his or her supervisor decide whether to give you a cash assistance loan or funds for services. Their decision will depend on the following factors:</p>
        <ol class="text">Whether there is money available;<sup><a href="#footnote-363" id="footnote-ref-363">[362]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">The circumstances, including your history and needs;<sup><a href="#footnote-364" id="footnote-ref-364">[363]</a></sup> AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether you are a citizen (as there are legal limits on the financial assistance that California State Parole can provide to certain parolees who are <em>not</em> U.S. citizens).<sup><a href="#footnote-365" id="footnote-ref-365">[364]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em> (1) FIRST TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Cash Assistance Loans:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">Cash assistance loans (a.k.a. “financial assistance funds”) are loans that you may request from your parole agent. CDCR expects you to pay back these loans as soon as possible (for example, once employment or other financial circumstances allow you to do so). These loans are only granted when there is a critical need and assistance is not available from any other source.<sup><a href="#footnote-366" id="footnote-ref-366">[365]</a></sup> The loans are usually for amounts under $50. The parole agent’s supervisor must approve any loan over $50 or any series of loans totaling more than $150 in a 30-day period.<sup><a href="#footnote-367" id="footnote-ref-367">[366]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>(2) SECOND TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Funds for Services</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">Your parole agent is also authorized to distribute funds for services (a.k.a. “bank drafts”), including for housing, food, and clothing. Your parole agent may authorize a loan of up to $500 for you to make over-the-counter purchases. The check may be written either directly to you or to the vendor who is selling the item you are purchasing. Once again, the loans are granted on an emergency basis, and you must pay the money back as soon as you can.<sup><a href="#footnote-368" id="footnote-ref-368">[367]</a></sup></p>
