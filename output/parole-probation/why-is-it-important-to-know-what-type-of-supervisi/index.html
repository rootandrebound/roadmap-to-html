          <h3><a id="_Toc448152775"></a>Why is it important to know what type of supervision I am on, and the rules of that supervision department?</h3>
          <p class="text">It is important to know what kind of supervision you are on, and what rules of supervision apply to you, because these rules impact every part of your life: where you can travel, where and how often you have to report to a supervising officer, the steps you should take if you are having a problem with the rules (“conditions”) of your supervision, the amount of time you’ll be under supervision in the community, the types of record-cleaning and record-improving remedies available to you, the type of contact you may have with certain people or family members, your ability to vote and serve on a jury, and MORE. This chapter will help to explain the rights and responsibilities you may have under each specific type of supervision — state parole; county probation, mandatory supervision, or PRCS; federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole.</p>
