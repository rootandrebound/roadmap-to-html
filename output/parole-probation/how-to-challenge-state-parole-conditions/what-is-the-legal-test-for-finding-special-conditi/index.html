        <h1>What is the legal test for finding special conditions of parole unlawful?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861071"></a>What is the legal test for finding special conditions of parole unlawful?</h3>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>This is a review from PG. 158! </em></strong>Courts have held that parole conditions are invalid if they don’t pass the following 4 tests:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>TEST 1:</strong> A parole condition is invalid if it: (1) has no relation to the commitment offense; (2) bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; AND (3) requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities. <strong><em>You must show that the parole condition is invalid based on all 3 factors </em></strong><em>(just one or two is not enough).</em></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>TEST 2:</strong> A parole condition is invalid if it infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>TEST 3:</strong> A parole condition may be invalid if it is excessively broad or so vague that your cannot understand or follow it.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>TEST 4:</strong> A parole condition is invalid if it limits the type of employment you can have, but does not directly relate to your crime.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>You will need to explain how the parole condition you are challenging is invalid under one of these legal tests.</strong></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are challenging the <em>length of your parole term</em>, you do not need to use these legal tests, but instead you would explain why the parole term length is incorrect based on the California Penal Code and Title 15 regulations. You would still use the same 602 appeals process described above. To learn more about parole term lengths, see PG. 148.</p>
        <h3><a id="PP_602AppealTimelines"></a><a id="_Toc352861072"></a>What timelines must I follow in submitting an administrative appeal? </h3>
        <p class="text">To submit an initial 602 administrative appeal, you have <strong>30 days</strong> after the problem, event or decision occurs, or after having first knowledge about the action or decision being appealed. If Parole’s response doesn’t satisfy you at the first- or second-level of the appeals process, you have <strong>30 days</strong> to submit a <strong>higher-level appeal</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-603" id="footnote-ref-603">[602]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Time limits don’t stop while you are trying to get supporting documents, so you should file your appeal and explain why you are unable to get the documents on time.<sup><a href="#footnote-604" id="footnote-ref-604">[603]</a></sup> The Appeals Coordinator might grant you additional time to get the documents.<sup><a href="#footnote-605" id="footnote-ref-605">[604]</a></sup> Failure to meet the timelines could lead to your appeal being rejected and being unable to go to court—so file your appeal as soon as possible after the problem or incident occurs.<sup><a href="#footnote-606" id="footnote-ref-606">[605]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> There are special timelines and procedures for submitting (1) emergency appeals (see PG. 175), (2) appeals of involuntary psychiatric transfer, and (3) disability-related appeals (see PG. 178).<sup><a href="#footnote-607" id="footnote-ref-607">[606]</a></sup> </p>
