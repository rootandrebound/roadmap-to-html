          <ol class="text">A judge finds you “factually innocent” of the charges for which you were arrested. A person is considered “factually innocent” when a court finds that “no reasonable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense for which the arrest was made;”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3159" id="footnote-ref-3159">[3123]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
