        <h3><a id="_Toc448153967"></a>When could I get my arrest record sealed?</h3>
        <p class="text">Generally, you must file a request to have your arrest record sealed within 2 years after the date of your arrest OR the date that charges were filed against you (whichever is later). However, the judge can waive (excuse) the 2-year time limit if you can show “<em>good cause</em>”<sup><a href="#footnote-3163" id="footnote-ref-3163">[3127]</a></sup>—meaning you can give the judge a really good reason why you <em>could not</em> or <em>did not</em> file your petition within the 2-year limit. </p>
        <p class="text">Since many people will be beyond the 2-year time limit, these are some examples of reasons that may qualify as “good cause:”</p>
        <ol class="text">If the charges are dismissed or you are acquitted more than 2 years after the date of your arrest or charging;</ol>
        <ol class="text">If the DA waited more than 2 years after the arrest, and then decided not to file charges;</ol>
        <ol class="text">In some cases, if you were trying to resolve your case informally, but were unsuccessful (but don’t wait too long afterward!).<sup><a href="#footnote-3164" id="footnote-ref-3164">[3128]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">Keep in mind, however, that it will be up to the judge to decide whether your reason is good enough to waive the 2-year limit.</p>
