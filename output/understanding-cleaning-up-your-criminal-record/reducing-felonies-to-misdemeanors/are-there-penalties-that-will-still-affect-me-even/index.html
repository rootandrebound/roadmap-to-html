        <h3><a id="_Toc448153930"></a>Are there penalties that will still affect me even if my felony is reduced to a misdemeanor?</h3>
        <p class="text"><em>Yes. </em>Unfortunately, reducing your felony conviction to a misdemeanor doesn’t get you completely off the felony hook. Some penalties will carry over and continue to affect you, even after your felony conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor. These include:</p>
        <ol class="text">If your conviction was for a serious or violent felony, it will still count as a prior “strike” under California’s Three Strikes Law;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3016" id="footnote-ref-3016">[2982]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If your conviction requires you to register as a sex offender under Penal Code section 290, you will still have to register after your felony is reduced;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3017" id="footnote-ref-3017">[2983]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You may still be subject to federal firearms restrictions;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3018" id="footnote-ref-3018">[2984]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Some state licensing agencies may still consider your conviction a felony.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3019" id="footnote-ref-3019">[2985]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">Also, please note that getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b) does NOT give you any legal rights to be compensated for any time that you served that is more than what you could have been sentenced to if you had been convicted of a misdemeanor originally.</p>
