        <h3><a id="_Toc352862245"></a>I’ve had a new conviction since my original offense? Can I still apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation for the original offense?</h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">CORs &amp; Pardons: </h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If the judge grants your COR, this will automatically send an application to the Governor for a pardon. You will not have to do anything more to apply for a pardon. (For more information about Governor’s pardons, see PG. 967.)</p>
        <p class="text">You are<em> allowed to</em> apply for a COR if you have a new conviction during your period of rehabilitation, <strong>BUT</strong> the judge will likely use the new conviction as a reason to deny your COR, and can require you to complete a new period of rehabilitation (see APPENDIX W, on PG. 1043) starting <em>from the date your COR is denied</em> (<em>not</em> from the time of the offense that led to the denial).<sup><a href="#footnote-3130" id="footnote-ref-3130">[3129]</a></sup> In addition, even if you get the new conviction expunged, the judge can still consider the <em>conduct</em> that led to the conviction when deciding whether to grant your COR.<sup><a href="#footnote-3131" id="footnote-ref-3131">[3130]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">The judge has discretion to consider <em>every interaction</em> with the law when determining whether to grant a COR.<sup><a href="#footnote-3132" id="footnote-ref-3132">[3131]</a></sup>Evidence presented at a COR hearing includes records from parole and probation, which would include any violations of your conditions, as well as “written reports or records of any other law enforcement agency” about you.<sup><a href="#footnote-3133" id="footnote-ref-3133">[3132]</a></sup></p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862246"></a>How do I get a Certificate of Rehabilitation? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you meet all of the requirements for a COR (see PG. 964) <em>and</em> you have completed your required period of rehabilitation (or you want to request a COR early), you will need to file papers (called a <em>Petition for Certificate of Rehabilitation</em>) in the court in the county where you <strong><em>currently live</em></strong>. Your petition will explain why you deserve a COR. It should include letters of support and proof of your accomplishments. The District Attorney will likely do an investigation and prepare a report about you. Then you will have a hearing where you will have to convince the judge that you are rehabilitated and ready to be a responsible member of society. </p>
        <p class="text">NOTE: You must request a COR from the court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>. This is different from most other remedies (such as expungement, reducing your felony to a misdemeanor, and Prop. 47), which require you to request them from the court <em>where you were convicted</em>. For complete information and instructions on how to request a Certificate of Rehabilitation, including a sample application, see APPENDIX X, on PG. 1044.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You have the <em>right</em> to a lawyer to help you with your request for a COR. You can hire a lawyer of your choice, or if you cannot afford a lawyer, the court must assign a public defender or another lawyer to help you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3134" id="footnote-ref-3134">[3133]</a></sup></sup> If you are just getting started and don’t yet have a lawyer, you should start by contacting the Public Defender’s Office <em>in the county where you live</em>, or look for a local expungement clinic in your area. You also have the right to get help with your request from the county probation department, state parole officers, the California Youth Authority (if you are under 30 years old), and any other rehabilitative agency.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3135" id="footnote-ref-3135">[3134]</a></sup></sup> </p>
