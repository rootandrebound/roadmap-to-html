        <h1>What protections are available under California’s state laws and the local practices of “sanctuary” cities and counties in the state?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862284"></a>What protections are available under California’s state laws and the local practices of “sanctuary” cities and counties in the state?</h3>
        <p class="textbox"><strong><em>“Sanctuary” defined:</em></strong> A “sanctuary” jurisdiction describes cities, counties, and states with policies designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. </p>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis">California’s Statewide Protections:</div>
        <ol class="text">In 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the <strong>Trust Act</strong> into law. As a result, state police cannot detain someone with the goal of turning them over to federal immigration authorities <em>unless</em> the person has been charged with or convicted of a <em>serious crime</em>.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Similarly, in 2016, Governor Brown signed the <strong>Truth Act</strong>, which created a number of protections for immigrants in California, including that if ICE places a detainer on someone in jail in California, <em>the jail staff must serve the person with a copy of that detainer</em>, which allows them more time to contact family and an attorney.</ol>
        <ol class="text">In addition, California issues special AB 60 “Undocumented Person” Driver’s Licenses to undocumented Californians, which allow undocumented people to legally drive in California without having their information sent to federal immigration agents. <strong>However, these driver’s licenses CANNOT be used out-of-state or in federal buildings like airports.</strong></ol>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis">Local “Sanctuary” Protections in California:</div>
        <ol class="text">In response to Trump’s Executive Order, California “sanctuary” cities and counties are fighting back, providing even stronger protections than the state of California, with San Francisco leading the charge. To learn more about which cities and counties provide special protections for undocumented immigrants, view the “sanctuary” map here: <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/local-enforcement-map">www.ilrc.org/local-enforcement-map</a>. Zoom into the map over your city, and if there is a colorful pin on the map, click it to learn more about local protections.</ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862285"></a>Do I have any options if I pled “guilty” or “no contest” in a criminal case if I didn’t know the immigration consequences of that decision? </h3>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Both state and federal law require criminal defense lawyers to advise their clients of, and defend against, the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction.<sup> </sup>This means you have <em>the right</em> to receive adequate advice from your criminal defense lawyer about the immigration consequences of your criminal case. The law requires defense lawyers (including public defenders) to ask about their clients’ citizenship status; investigate potential immigration consequences; advise their clients about those immigration consequences; and plea-bargain with an eye toward avoiding them. On the next page, you will find a chart that summarizes situations where immigrants have some options to challenge a plea agreement in their criminal case because you were not adequately advised on the immigration consequences.</p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong><em>“Vacated” </em>–<em> a legal term defined: </em></strong>“Vacate” means to erase, cancel or void. We use it in the chart, so refer back to this definition if you are unclear. But note that if your conviction has been <em>vacated</em>, the District Attorney may be able to prosecute you on the original criminal charges. For all of these, ask you attorney for advice about the best path in your case!</p>
        <p class="text">Because Trump is prioritizing the removal of people involved in the criminal justice system, any options for getting rid of convictions is especially critical at this point. <strong>Consult with an attorney who specializes in criminal and immigration law to find out what makes sense under your particular circumstances. </strong></p>
        <p class="text">This chart summarizes different options for challenging your plea agreement if you did not know or understand the immigration consequences of your conviction. You can share this with your lawyer to help you decide which, if any, are the best options available to you.</p>

        <h3><a id="_Toc352862286"></a>Are there any other ways that I can clean up my record that might help me for immigration purposes? </h3>
        <p class="text">Maybe! Some of California’s “record-cleaning” or “expungement” laws may help you <strong>reduce certain felonies to misdemeanors, and/or dismiss certain convictions</strong> – which in some cases can also help reduce your chances of being targeted for deportation and other negative immigration consequences. Below is a summary of California’s record-cleaning laws that may help people with their immigration status. </p>
        <p class="text">To get help pursuing one of these “record-cleaning” options, contact your local public defender’s office or call Root &amp; Rebound’s free and confidential Reentry Legal Hotline any Friday at (510) 279-4662 for a referral to a free expungement legal clinic.</p>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis">Dismissals (also known as “expungements”):</div>
        <p class="text">When lawyers refer to “expungements” in California (which don’t really exist here), they usually mean <strong>“dismissals,”</strong> which allow people to dismiss a felony or misdemeanor conviction after completing any time they were sentenced to jail, prison and/or probation. While dismissals can help with applying to some jobs and housing, they usually do not erase the conviction for immigration purposes.<sup> </sup><em>However,</em> there is one important exception for certain first-time simple possession offenses that occurred <strong><em>before July 14, 2011</em></strong>, where a dismissal may help with immigration consequences.</p>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis">Reducing Felonies to Misdemeanors:</div>
        <p class="text">The following newer laws help people reduce felonies to misdemeanors for all purposes, including for immigration purposes.</p>
        <ol class="text">Under <strong>Cal. Penal Code section 17(b)(3)</strong>, the court can reduce felony “wobblers” – offenses that originally could have been charged as either felonies or misdemeanors – down to misdemeanors if you were not sentenced to state prison.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Under California’s <strong>Proposition 47</strong>, you can petition the court to reduce a felony conviction for simple drug possession or a lower-level theft offense to a misdemeanor (called “reclassification” or “redesignation”).</ol>
        <ol class="text">Under California’s <strong>Proposition 64</strong>, you may be able to change your record (called “reclassification”) if you have a conviction for a marijuana offense, which means you might be able to reduce or dismiss prior marijuana-related convictions.</ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">A Warning about “Legalized Marijuana” under Prop. 64 in California: </h4>
        <p class="textbox">Although California state law permits some use and cultivation of marijuana, federal law does NOT allow this – and remember, immigration is run by the federal government! So please read and share the warnings below!</p>
        <ul class="textbox">Don’t use marijuana until you are a U.S. citizen. Don’t work in a marijuana shop.If you have a real medical need and there is no good substitute for medical marijuana, get legal counsel.Never leave the house carrying marijuana, a medical marijuana card, paraphernalia (like a pipe), or accessories like marijuana T-shirts or stickers. Don’t have photos or text about you and marijuana on your phone, Facebook, or anywhere else.</ul>
        <p class="textbox">Most importantly, <strong><em>never admit to any immigration or border official that you ever have used or possessed marijuana</em></strong>, unless you have expert legal advice that this is OK. If a federal official asks you about marijuana, say that you don’t want to talk to them and you want to speak to a lawyer. You have the right to remain silent. Stay strong – once you admit it, you can’t take it back. If you did admit this to a federal officer, get legal help quickly. See Appendix JJ on PG. 1074 for more information.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">SPECIAL NOTE: Cal. Penal Code section 18.5(b) (effective January 1, 2017) is a recent state law that reduces the <em>maximum possible sentence</em> for any California misdemeanor from 365 to 364 days retroactively. This is important because under federal law, certain offenses can lead to deportation if they carry even a potential sentence of one year or more. This new law is retroactive, meaning it applies to old misdemeanors as well those current and future cases. However, if you were convicted of a misdemeanor before January 1, 2015, and were sentenced to a term of one year, you must proactively ask (“petition”) the criminal court that sentenced you to change your sentence under this law.</p>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis">Completing a Drug Diversion Program:</div>
        <p class="text">In addition, under <strong><em>Cal. Penal Code Section 1203.43</em></strong>, someone with a drug offense who received a “deferred entry of judgment” (DEJ) can get rid of the conviction for immigration purposes. You are considered to have a conviction for immigration purposes if you entered a plea of guilty even <em>if the charges were later dismissed through a diversion program</em>; so getting relief through Section 1203.43 gets rid of your guilty plea for immigration purposes as well. Upon completion of the court-ordered DEJ program, you must file papers with the court to ask the judge to withdraw the guilty plea and dismiss the charges once again under Section 1203.43.</p>
        <p class="text">If you have any questions, please see the list of additional resources and legal organizations listed below – many help people fight deportation. You can also call Root &amp; Rebound’s free and confidential Reentry Legal Hotline any Friday at (510) 279-4662 for a referral.</p>
