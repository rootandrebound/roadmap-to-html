        <h1>If I am required to register with local law enforcement because of a sex, arson, or drug conviction, how will cleaning up my record affect my registration requirement?</h1>
        <p class="text">Like most other questions about cleaning your record, this will depend on the specific details of your situation, including the type of registration requirement you have, your conviction offense, and which of these “remedies” you use to clean up your record. Certain remedies can remove your registration requirement, while others will NOT affect your registration requirement at all, so you will still have to register. For more information about which “cleaning remedies” DO and DON’T affect your registration requirements, see PG. 985.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>California offers these remedies to help you clean up your record…</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">You can correct errors, fill in incomplete information, or add missing information in your record (see PG. 923 to learn about fixing errors in your RAP sheet, and see PG. 928 to learn about fixing errors in a background check);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be able to get your conviction(s) expunged (see PG. 940);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be able to get your felony conviction reduced (see PG. 951), or reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor (see PG. 953);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 964);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be able to get a pardon from the governor (see PG. 967);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be able to get your adult arrest record(s) sealed (see PG. 972) or get your juvenile criminal records sealed (see PG. 974);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You may be able to get your federal conviction expunged (see PG. 976) or get a Presidential Pardon (see PG. 979).</ol>
        <p class="widetableintroitalcaps">Here is a basic overview of the different remedies available for cleaning up your record, and the rules for each type of remedy. For more information about each of these remedies, turn to the page number listed in the chart.</p>

        <p class="text"><strong><em>Be prepared to show support for your clean record!</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">For almost every type of “cleaning” remedy, you will need to convince a judge (or sometimes the Governor or President) of why you deserve the remedy you are asking for. When you ask to have your record cleaned up (usually by filing papers in court or with the government), you will want to make sure that the judge (or Governor) has <em>all possible materials that support your request</em>, such as letters of support, school transcripts, awards, certificates of achievement, and diplomas. </p>
