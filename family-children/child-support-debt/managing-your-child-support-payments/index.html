            <p class="text">It depends on the <em>date</em> when your most recent child support order was <em>issued</em> by the judge AND for <em>how long</em> you were incarcerated.

            <p class="text">You can make payments by one of the following methods, depending on whether or not the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved:</p>
            <ol class="text">If the LCSA is involved (there is a formal arrangement for support payments between you and the other parent or caregiver:</ol>
            <ol class="text">When you pay your child support, you are making these payments to the California State Disbursement Unit (SDU).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2538" id="footnote-ref-2538">[2537]</a></sup></sup> Under federal law, the California SDU is required to process 100% of child support payments (which used to be processed by the LCSA itself, but no longer).<sup><a href="#footnote-2539" id="footnote-ref-2539">[2538]</a></sup></ol>

            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintKeep Records of Your Payments!</h4>
            <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! Whether you are making your payments to the California SDU or directly to the other parent, it’s a good idea to <em>always keep a record of every payment you make</em>. You can keep a separate notebook where you write down the <em>date</em> and <em>amount</em> of each payment, or make notes on a calendar every time you make a payment (including the date and amount).</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint	I lost my job or went to jail and cannot afford my child support payments!	</h4>
            <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! If you cannot pay or are falling behind on your child support payments because you lost your job, went to jail, or some other important changes have happened, it’s recommended that you<em> immediately</em> contact the LCSA and/or family court and ask to change your child support amount. Don’t wait! You are responsible for paying the full amount of child support until the LSCA or judge changes the child support order. For more information about changing your child support order, see Appendix L, PG. 815.</p>
            <li id="footnote-2538"><p> Telephone and online payments also require a debit card, credit card, or bank information. For both telephone and online payments, you can make a single (one-time) payment or set up an account to make ongoing payments.  <a href="#footnote-ref-2538">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text"><em>If you are employed</em>, a portion of your wages will be automatically taken out to pay your current and/or overdue child support (called a <em>wage assignment</em> or <em>wage garnishment</em>).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2541" id="footnote-ref-2541">[2540]</a></sup></sup> This will happen even if you only owe <em>current</em> child support payments, without any overdue payments or interest. If your child support payments are being taken directly from your wages, you should not need to make other payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2542" id="footnote-ref-2542">[2541]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">If you are not employed, or if your child support is not being taken from your wages, you must make child support payments directly. </p>

            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your CURRENT and FUTURE child support payments is different than the process for changing your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt. This question will explain how to change your <em>current</em> child support payments. To learn about changing your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt, see PG. 777770.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p class="text">First the bad news: In general, you CANNOT go back and change the amount of past, overdue child support payments and interest that you owe. (The only exception is for child support orders issued on or after July 1, 2011, or if you agree to settle your past debts owed the other parent or the state—see PG. 770 to learn more).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2543" id="footnote-ref-2543">[2542]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">But you CAN ask the judge to change the amount of child support that you have to pay in the future, starting from the date when you file your court papers. You CAN also ask the judge to set up a monthly payment plan so you can repay what you owe in installments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2544" id="footnote-ref-2544">[2543]</a></sup></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">To ask for a change in your child support payments while incarcerated, fill out the “Incarcerated Parent’s Request to Review Child Support” form and send it to your local child support agency (LCSA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2545" id="footnote-ref-2545">[2544]</a></sup></sup> You can ask the prison or jail for a copy of this form, or for a sample form. If the form is not available, you should contact the LCSA immediately by phone or letter, and explain that you are incarcerated and need to change your child support payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2546" id="footnote-ref-2546">[2545]</a></sup></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">See Appendix A, PG. 788, to find contact information for a list of LCSAs by county in California.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In general, the judge can only change the amount of child support you owe for <em>future</em> payments (starting from the day you file papers asking for the change). The judge cannot reduce the amount of <em>past</em> child support that you owe. Therefore, you should contact the LCSA and/or file your court papers <em>as soon as you are incarcerated</em>, if possible, to request a change in your payments.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>If you are served with new child support papers while in prison or jail</em>, you should contact the LCSA listed on the paperwork right away. It is best to contact the LCSA <em>in writing</em>, by filling out and sending back the blank <em>Response</em> form that you receive with the court papers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2547" id="footnote-ref-2547">[2546]</a></sup> You only have <em>30 days</em> (starting from the day you receive the papers) to respond to the LCSA and/or the court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2548" id="footnote-ref-2548">[2547]</a></sup></sup> You must notify the LCSA again once you are released.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2549" id="footnote-ref-2549">[2548]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">To change the amount of your current and future child support payments, you must ask the judge or LCSA (if involved in your case) to change your child support order.</p>

If the LCSA is NOT involved in your case, you and the other parent (or caregiver) can agree to make child support payments in some other way, and can ask the judge to “stay” (put on hold) the wage assignment. In this situation, both parents (or caregiver) work out how child support will be paid and handle it between them. If the LCSA is involved in your case, the LCSA will have to agree to have the wage assignment put on hold. This may be difficult, however, because LCSAs usually prefer you to make child support payments through a wage assignment with your employer, and want all child support payments to go through the state payment system (called the State Disbursement Unit), NOT to the other parent directly.

          <h2><a href="/family-children/child-support-debt/managing-your-child-support-payments/i-am-formerly-incarcerated-and-owe-money-for-past-/">I am formerly incarcerated and owe money for past, overdue child support payments (“arrears”). How can I change these arrears?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">It depends on the <em>date</em> when your most recent child support order was issued by the judge AND for <em>how long</em> you were incarcerated.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>POSSIBILITY #1: If your current child support order was issued on or after July 1, 2011 AND you were incarcerated for 90 days or more:</strong></p>
            <p class="text">Your payments <em>should have</em> automatically stopped while you are incarcerated (see Appendix L, PG. 815, for more information about automatically stopping your child support payments while incarcerated). After you are released, if you discover that your child support payments were <em>not</em> automatically stopped—i.e., if you find that you owe child support from while you were incarcerated—you can ask the judge to “adjust” your child support arrears (i.e., reduce your debt to $0) for the time you were incarcerated. </p>
            <p class="text">To do this, fill out the Request for Judicial Determination of Support Arrearages or Adjustment of Arrearages Due to Incarceration or Involuntary Institutionalization (Form FL-676, available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl676.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl676.pdf</a> or in Appendix L, PG. 815), and file it with the family court where your child support order is from. You will need to prove: (1) the dates when you were incarcerated, and (2) that you could not afford to pay child support while you were incarcerated (i.e., that you had no income or other money during that time.) However, if you were incarcerated for a domestic violence or harassment offense, or for violating a previous child support order, OR if you had outside income or assets and could afford to make child support payments while you were incarcerated, the judge may refuse to reduce your debt.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2555" id="footnote-ref-2555">[2554]</a></sup></sup> BUT remember—this ONLY applies if your child support order was on or after July 1, 2011 AND you are incarcerated for 90 days or more.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>POSSIBILITY #2: If your current child support order was NOT issued on or after July 1, 2011, or you were incarcerated for less than 90 days: </strong></p>
            <p class="text">Your payments do NOT stop during your incarceration, so you will continue to owe child support payments for this time (unless you asked the LCSA or judge to change your payments while incarcerated—see the next question for more information about how to do this). Unfortunately, the judge <em>cannot</em> go back and change your overdue payments in this case, but you <em>can</em> ask the LCSA or other parent to forgive some of your overdue payments (see next question), and you <em>can</em> ask the judge to change your current child support payments going forward. </p>

            <p class="text">It depends, but probably not entirely.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt (“arrears”) is <em>different</em> than the process for changing your CURRENT child support payment amount. This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt. To learn about changing your <em>current</em> child support payments, see PG. 774.</p>
            <p class="text">This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue </em>child support debt.</p>
            <h4 class="step">First, figure out whether you owe overdue child support payments to the other parent (or caregiver) or to the state.</h4>
            <p class="text">To find out, you can contact the LCSA and ask for a breakdown (detailed list) of your arrears. This will show how much you owe to the other parent and/or to the state. The chart below can also help you figure out whom you owe child support to—but it’s always best to get a breakdown from the LCSA to be sure!</p>

            <p class="text">Yes. If you owe <em>any</em> child support payments (current and/or past, overdue payments), a portion of your public benefits payments can be automatically taken out to pay off your child support obligations. Your child support payments can be taken out of <em>any</em> benefits you receive <em>except</em> for General Assistance/General Relief (GA/GR) and SSI.<sup><a href="#footnote-2561" id="footnote-ref-2561">[2560]</a></sup> That means your payments can be taken out of your unemployment, disability, workers compensation, veteran’s benefits, or any other benefits you earn.</p>
            <p class="text">However, if you are already receiving public assistance, the judge <em>may </em>decide that your income is <em>too low</em> to owe <em>current</em> child support payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2562" id="footnote-ref-2562">[2561]</a></sup> BUT—this <em>only</em> applies to <em>current</em> payments. Even if the judge decides that your income is too low for <em>current</em> payments, you will still owe any <em>past, overdue</em> child support payments that were due in the past. You should ask the judge for a payment plan that lets you to make small payments over time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2563" id="footnote-ref-2563">[2562]</a></sup> <strong>Remember: </strong>The only way you can avoid paying past, overdue child support payments is (1) if your child support order was issued on or after July 1, 2011, and the payments were due while you were incarcerated for 90 days or more; OR (2) if you get a settlement agreement with the COAP program or other parent.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>For more information on paying child support</em>, you can talk to the court Family Law Facilitator, contact the LCSA, or visit the California Courts’ website on <em>Paying a Child Support Order</em> at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm</a>.</p>
