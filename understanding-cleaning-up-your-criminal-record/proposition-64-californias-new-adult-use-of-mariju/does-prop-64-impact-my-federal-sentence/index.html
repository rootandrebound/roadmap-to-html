        <h1>Does Prop. 64 impact my federal sentence?</h1>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Even though Prop. 64 only applies to state sentences, it still could help you if you are serving time for or at risk of deportation for a federal conviction. If your federal sentence was increased because you had a prior state conviction, sealing that conviction or reducing it to a misdemeanor could decrease the length of your sentence. If you are serving a federal sentence and have a prior state conviction possibly affected by Proposition 64, contact the federal lawyer who represented you, the federal public defender, and/or the county public defender where you were convicted immediately for assistance.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc478945234"></a><a id="_Toc352862237"></a>Does Prop. 64 help with immigration consequences? </h3>
        <p class="text">Maybe. First, under Prop. 64, misdemeanor sentences cannot be longer than 364 days. So if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction and Prop. 64 redesignates your conviction to a misdemeanor or infraction, this reclassification could have a significant impact for you. In your petition or in court (if you have a hearing), it may help you to ask the court to note on the record the new maximum sentence. Second, because Prop. 64 labels some relevant convictions “legally invalid,” you may be able to argue these “legally invalid” convictions should not affect immigration because they were “legal defects.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3111" id="footnote-ref-3111">[3110]</a></sup></sup> Contact a lawyer immediately for help with this situation.  See PG. 984 for a list of legal aid organizations that help with immigration issues.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862238"></a>Can employers located in California still drug test me even though Prop. 64 passed? Can employers refuse to hire me or fire me for using marijuana? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. Even though Prop. 64 passed, California employers can still conduct drug tests during the application process, and even once someone has been hired. Employers can also refuse to hire you and can fire you for using marijuana. There are two reasons why employers are allowed to test, refuse to hire, and/or fire you for marijuana use. First, employers are allowed to create rules to maintain a drug-free workplace by making sure that employees don't come to work under the influence of marijuana or use marijuana at work.<sup><a href="#footnote-3112" id="footnote-ref-3112">[3111]</a></sup> Second, marijuana possession and use is still illegal under federal law, and employers are allowed to create rules to ensure that their employees don’t violate state or federals laws at the workplace or on employer property.<sup><a href="#footnote-3113" id="footnote-ref-3113">[3112]</a></sup> Learn more about your employment rights with a criminal record in the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 551.</p>
