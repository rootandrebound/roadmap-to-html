        <h1>What does expungement do?</h1>
        <ol class="text">An expungement makes it so that <em>most</em> private employers CANNOT see the expunged conviction when they run a background check on you. </ol>
        <ol class="text">On job applications for (most) <em>private</em> employers, if you are asked if you have any convictions, you can answer ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2967" id="footnote-ref-2967">[2966]</a></sup></sup> <strong>EXCEPTION</strong>: On applications for certain jobs, you MUST report convictions even if they have been expunged. (For more information about who can still see or ask about expunged convictions, see PG.¬†941.)</ol>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>IMPORTANT ‚ÄúBAN THE BOX‚Äù LAWS:</strong> Several California cities and counties have passed ‚ÄúBan the Box‚Äù laws that bar employers from asking about convictions on a job application. If you apply for a job in a location with a ‚ÄúBan the Box‚Äù law, the application should not ask about any convictions. For more information on Ban the Box laws, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG.¬†565.</p>
        <ol class="text">Anyone else who does see the expungement will see it as a dismissal instead of a conviction, which is less alarming.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you apply for a professional or occupational license or certification, an expungement can help your chances because it is seen as <em>evidence of rehabilitation</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2968" id="footnote-ref-2968">[2967]</a></sup></sup> (Although the licensing board will still be able to see that there was a conviction that was dismissed.) For more information on licensing and certification, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG.¬†565.</ol>
        <ol class="text">An expungement may also be seen as evidence of rehabilitation when you apply for housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2969" id="footnote-ref-2969">[2968]</a></sup></sup> Learn more in the HOUSING CHAPTER, PG.¬†366).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you were denied federal student loans because of a drug conviction, you will become eligible again after an expungement.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2970" id="footnote-ref-2970">[2969]</a></sup></sup> For more information about regaining eligibility for federal aid after a drug conviction, see the EDUCATION CHAPTER, on PG.¬†872, and EDUCATION CHAPTER: Appendix¬†B, on PG.¬†890).</ol>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you are a non-citizen and you have been convicted of a DUI offense, getting your conviction expunged <em>might</em> have immigration benefits for you. It‚Äôs recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately if you have a DUI and you are a non-citizen. See the new section on immigration consequences of criminal records starting on PG.¬†980, which includes a list of legal aid resources.</p>
