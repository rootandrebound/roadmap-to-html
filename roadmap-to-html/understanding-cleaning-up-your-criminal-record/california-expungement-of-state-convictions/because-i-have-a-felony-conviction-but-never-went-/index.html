        <h1>Because I have a felony conviction, but never went to prison for it, can I get it expunged?</h1>
        <h4 class="sidebox">is it a “Wobbler”?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by checking the California Penal Code section reported on your RAP sheet. If the code states that the crime is punishable either a fine, time in the county jail, time in state prison, or any combination of these, your offense is considered a wobbler.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p class="text">Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony, but you were NOT sentenced to serve a state prison term, your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as <em>either</em> a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. If you were convicted of a felony<em> wobbler</em> AND you were NOT sentenced to a state prison term, your offense is probably eligible for expungement. </p>
        <p class="text">“Wobblers” are eligible for expungement if:<sup><a href="#footnote-2990" id="footnote-ref-2990">[2989]</a></sup> </p>
        <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to a state prison term for the offense; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;</ol>
        <ol class="text">You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 943); AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for information on the two types of expungement and their requirements, see PG. 944). </ol>
        <p class="text"><em>If you meet the above requirements, your felony should be eligible for expungement. </em></p>
