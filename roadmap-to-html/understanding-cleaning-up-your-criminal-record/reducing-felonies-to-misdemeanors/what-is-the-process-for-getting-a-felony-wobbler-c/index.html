        <h1>What is the process for getting a felony ‚Äúwobbler‚Äù conviction reduced to a misdemeanor, and then expunged?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you want to reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor AND get your conviction expunged, it is generally very easy to do both at the same time! In fact, the<em> Petition for Dismissal (Form CR‚Äî180) </em>that you must file to get your conviction expunged has a box that you can check to say that your conviction is also eligible to be reduced and to request it. </p>
        <p class="text">Then, when you have your court hearing for your expungement, the judge will consider both requests‚Äîfirst your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. If you meet all the requirements, the judge usually will grant both of your requests together. (For a list of the requirements for reducing a felony to a misdemeanor, see PG.¬†951. For a list of requirements to get your conviction expunged, see PG.¬†942.) For more details on how to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor, see APPENDIX¬†R, on PG.¬†1022. </p>
        <p class="text">If the judge does NOT reduce your felony to a misdemeanor, or if your felony is only eligible for reduction but not expungement, you may need to file a separate petition to get it reduced. It is recommended that you ask a lawyer to help you with this. For more information about filing a separate petition to ask for your felony conviction to be reduced, see APPENDIX¬†R, on PG.¬†1022. </p>
