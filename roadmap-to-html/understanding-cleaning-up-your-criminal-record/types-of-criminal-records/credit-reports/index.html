            <p class="text">In California, a credit report is different from a background check and is covered by a different set of laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-2947" id="footnote-ref-2947">[2946]</a></sup> A credit report contains information about your money and finances—including debts you owe (such as unpaid bills, loans, or leases), your payment history for past bills and debts, and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit report does NOT include your criminal history or other personal information about you. For this reason, this legal guide does not go into detail about the laws governing credit reports.</p>

            <p class="text">Generally, no. Background check companies are NOT allowed to include your credit report in your regular background check, because not everyone who is allowed to see your background check is also allowed to see your credit report. When companies run your credit report, they must follow a separate set of rules that are specific to credit reports, which are not covered in this guide. The only time that your credit report and background check will be together is when someone who is <em>ALLOWED to see both</em> requests them together (for example, a landlord can request both at the same time, but most employers cannot see your <em>credit</em> report, just your criminal background check).<sup><a href="#footnote-2948" id="footnote-ref-2948">[2947]</a></sup> </p>

            <p class="text">MOST PEOPLE CANNOT SEE YOUR RAP SHEET. Your RAP sheet is protected and confidential because it is kept by law enforcement agencies. The only people who can see your RAP sheet are: </p>

            <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Most public employers</span> can see your RAP sheet when you apply for a job with them. These include all federal, state and local government agencies—including police and fire departments, the California Department of Corrections (CDCR), local Boards of Education, and the U.S. Postal Service.<sup><a href="#footnote-2952" id="footnote-ref-2952">[2951]</a></sup></ol>

            <p class="text">Unlike a RAP sheet, many more people (for housing, employments, bank loans, public benefits, etc.) can run a private background check on you, but it is still protected from showing everything in most cases. In California, state and federal laws<sup><a href="#footnote-2954" id="footnote-ref-2954">[2953]</a></sup> allow background check companies to run background checks and send the information…</p>
            <ol class="text">To anyone making decisions about you for: employment, renting a house/apartment, professional licensing, government benefits, credit obligations,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2955" id="footnote-ref-2955">[2954]</a></sup></sup> court-ordered child support or alimony, or insurance;</ol>

            <p class="text">Basically, the main people who can—and are likely to—run a background check on you are employers, private landlords, insurance companies, licensing boards and agencies, and financial institutions. </p>
            <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, there are LIMITS on what information can be included in your background check. In general, <em>cleaning up your record</em> means that the information may no longer show up in the background checks that <em>most</em> people—like ordinary employers and private landlords—can get.</p>

            <p class="text">Yes. Because most criminal records and criminal case information is technically public, people in the general public could access on their own most legal paperwork filed in court or with a government agency. For example, anyone can go to the local courthouse, look up your criminal case and make copies of the documents in the court file. </p>
            <p class="text">But it is very unlikely that most people would go down to the courthouse to look you up for an apartment or job! Keep in mind that the information is likely scattered across hundreds of locations, so someone would really have to know exactly what they are looking for to actually find it. That’s why most people use professional background check companies to do the investigating for them—and that’s why these companies and the background checks they create are regulated by state and federal laws to protect you! </p>

            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If there’s ANY possibility that you might have an outstanding warrant for your arrest—for ANY reason (including new charges against you or a failure to appear in court) from ANY county—it is recommended that you call the public defender or a private lawyer to check on your warrant status first, before trying to get your RAP sheet.</p>

            <p class="text">If you have ever been arrested or had a conviction in another state, or for a federal offense, you will want to get a copy of your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your “Identity History Summary.” </p>

            <p class="text">There are two ways to get a copy of your FBI RAP sheet:</p>
            <ol class="text">You can request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI; OR</ol>
            <ol class="text">You can use a special private company, called a “Channeler,” that has contracted with the FBI to perform this service.</ol>
            <p class="text">NOTE: It is generally faster to go through an FBI Channeler, but it is likely to be more expensive because these companies usually charge extra fees.</p>
            <p class="text">Whether you request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI or go through a channeler, you will need to fill out the FBI’s “Applicant Information Form” and get fingerprinted by a Live Scan service provider.

            <p class="text">The process for getting your local RAP sheet is different in each county. In some counties, you can get a complete RAP sheet that has ALL of your criminal history information from that county in one place, including all of your convictions, arrests, and any open warrants. In other counties, these records are kept separately (by different agencies), so you will need to go to several places and get separate records for all of your court cases (convictions), arrest records, and warrants. </p>
            <p class="text">You will need to contact the police department, sheriff’s department, courthouse, or Public Defender’s Office of the county where you were convicted for information on how to get your local RAP sheet. </p>
            <p class="importantbox">Remember, your county RAP sheet and other records will ONLY show information for <em>that county</em>. If you’ve had any interaction with the police, courts, highway patrol, or any other law enforcement or criminal justice agencies in other counties, you should get your California (DOJ) RAP sheet to see all of your criminal history information.</p>

            <p class="text">The best way to find out what information might show up in your background check is to get your own background check done <em>on yourself</em>. </p>
            <p class="text">There are 2 ways to do this:</p>
            <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 1</strong>: <strong>Pay a <em>reputable</em> background check company to run a report on you.</strong></p>
            <p class="text">There are MANY private background check companies out there—you can search online for “background checks” or check your local Yellow Pages under “Investigators.” Beware, however, some background check companies are scams. Look up or call a few different companies to see what they offer and how much they charge. Avoid companies that seem to charge much more or much less than others.</p>
            <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 2: Request a background check report.</strong></p>
            <p class="text">Under federal and state law, you are entitled to get a FREE copy of your background check once every 12 months from any background check company.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2958" id="footnote-ref-2958">[2957]</a></sup></sup> To get a copy of your background check for free, you must confirm <em>in writing</em> that <em>1 of the following </em>is true: </p>
            <ol class="text">You are unemployed and intend to look for work within the next 60 days; </ol>
            <ol class="text">You receive public benefits (government assistance such as CalFresh or General Assistance); OR</ol>
            <ol class="text">You believe there may be errors in your report because you have been the victim of fraud or identity theft.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2959" id="footnote-ref-2959">[2958]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <p class="text">Send a letter to whichever background check company you choose stating that you fall into one of the above categories (and list which category), and that you would like to request your free background check. </p>

            <p class="text">In general, <em>cleaning up your criminal record</em> can reduce many of the damaging effects associated with having a criminal history: </p>
            <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record can hide criminal records from certain people who run background checks on you—meaning most private employers, private landlords, and other private individuals or companies will NOT be able to see much of the information in your record.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record may allow you to say that you were never convicted of a particular offense; and/or may restore many of the rights that you lost because of a conviction (for example, voting rights, right to sit on a jury service, gun rights, etc.)</ol>
            <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record can reduce or remove the legal restrictions that prevent you from getting certain jobs and professional licenses.</ol>
            <p class="text">Cleaning up your record will make it easier to rebuild your life, move forward, and maximize your opportunities for success in the future. The first step toward cleaning up your criminal record is understanding the different types of records you may have and the information that may be in them.</p>

          <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/types-of-criminal-records/credit-reports/if-i-am-required-to-register-with-local-law-enforc/">If I am required to register with local law enforcement because of a sex, arson, or drug conviction, how will cleaning up my record affect my registration requirement?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Like most other questions about cleaning your record, this will depend on the specific details of your situation, including the type of registration requirement you have, your conviction offense, and which of these “remedies” you use to clean up your record. Certain remedies can remove your registration requirement, while others will NOT affect your registration requirement at all, so you will still have to register. For more information about which “cleaning remedies” DO and DON’T affect your registration requirements, see PG. 985.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>California offers these remedies to help you clean up your record…</strong></p>
            <ol class="text">You can correct errors, fill in incomplete information, or add missing information in your record (see PG. 923 to learn about fixing errors in your RAP sheet, and see PG. 928 to learn about fixing errors in a background check);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be able to get your conviction(s) expunged (see PG. 940);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be able to get your felony conviction reduced (see PG. 951), or reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor (see PG. 953);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 964);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be able to get a pardon from the governor (see PG. 967);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be able to get your adult arrest record(s) sealed (see PG. 972) or get your juvenile criminal records sealed (see PG. 974);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You may be able to get your federal conviction expunged (see PG. 976) or get a Presidential Pardon (see PG. 979).</ol>

            <p class="text"><strong><em>Be prepared to show support for your clean record!</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">For almost every type of “cleaning” remedy, you will need to convince a judge (or sometimes the Governor or President) of why you deserve the remedy you are asking for. When you ask to have your record cleaned up (usually by filing papers in court or with the government), you will want to make sure that the judge (or Governor) has <em>all possible materials that support your request</em>, such as letters of support, school transcripts, awards, certificates of achievement, and diplomas. </p>

            <p class="text">The best way to get this information is from your RAP sheet. You will need the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your convictions.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>Choose the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your cases:</em></p>
            <ol class="text">Your local (county) RAP sheet will list only your cases <em>in that county</em>, so only use this if ALL of your cases are from the SAME COUNTY (or if you only have 1 case). For information on getting your local county RAP sheet, see PG. 935.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your California (DOJ) RAP sheet will list all of your cases in <em>California</em>, so use this if ALL of your cases are from the state of CALIFORNIA only. For instructions on how to get your DOJ RAP sheet, see APPENDIX A, on PG. 990.)</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet will list all of your cases from EVERY STATE as well as FEDERAL offenses. Use this if you have cases from more than one state or any federal convictions. For instructions on how to get your FBI RAP sheet, see APPENDIX D, on PG. 996.</ol>
            <p class="text">You may <em>also</em> be able to get information on a case from the following sources:</p>
            <ol class="text"><em>Your court papers from your case</em>.</ol>
            <ol class="text">BUT court papers will <em>only</em> contain information about <em>that particular case</em>. If you have multiple cases, especially if they are from different counties, it may be easier to get a copy of your full California RAP sheet (or FBI RAP sheet, if you also have federal or out-of-state cases). </ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>Your lawyer, parole agent, probation officer, or other people at the courts or law enforcement agencies</em>. </ol>
            <ol class="text">BUT these people may only have <em>limited information</em> about your case, or may have information about <em>1 case but NOT others</em>, so it’s better to go through the formal channels of getting your full RAP sheet.</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>The criminal court where your case was decided</em>. </ol>
            <ol class="text">BUT the court will <em>only</em> have information for <em>cases from that county</em> and NOT other counties. If you only have cases from 1 county, make sure you get copies of ALL of your court papers for ALL of your cases in that county.</ol>
            <p class="text">Now that you have your criminal records and you know what’s in them, you are ready to begin cleaning them up!</p>
