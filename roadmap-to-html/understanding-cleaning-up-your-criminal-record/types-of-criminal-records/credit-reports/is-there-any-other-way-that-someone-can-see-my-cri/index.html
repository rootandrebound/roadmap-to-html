        <h1>Is there any other way that someone can see my criminal history?</h1>
        <p class="text">Yes. Because most criminal records and criminal case information is technically public, people in the general public could access on their own most legal paperwork filed in court or with a government agency. For example, anyone can go to the local courthouse, look up your criminal case and make copies of the documents in the court file. </p>
        <p class="text">But it is very unlikely that most people would go down to the courthouse to look you up for an apartment or job! Keep in mind that the information is likely scattered across hundreds of locations, so someone would really have to know exactly what they are looking for to actually find it. That’s why most people use professional background check companies to do the investigating for them—and that’s why these companies and the background checks they create are regulated by state and federal laws to protect you! </p>
        <h2><a id="Expung_GettingCopiesCriminalRecords"></a><a id="_Toc352862177"></a>GETTING COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS</h2>
        <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">Why it’s important to get a copy of your RAP sheet and background check;How to get your state, federal, and county RAP sheets;How to get a copy of your background check.</ul>
        <p class="text">This section explains how you can get copies of your various types of criminal records. You will need the information from your criminal record(s) to figure out which options are best for cleaning them up, and to complete the steps to do so.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If there’s ANY possibility that you might have an outstanding warrant for your arrest—for ANY reason (including new charges against you or a failure to appear in court) from ANY county—it is recommended that you call the public defender or a private lawyer to check on your warrant status first, before trying to get your RAP sheet.</p>
        <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_HowGetCARAP"></a><a id="_Toc352862178"></a>How do I get my California State<em> </em>(DOJ) RAP sheet? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">REMINDER: WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO GET MY RAP SHEET? </h4>
        <ul class="sidebox">To correct any errors, such as incomplete or incorrect information;To have an accurate record of your conviction history;To be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history; ANDYou will need it to clean up your record!</ul>
        <p class="text">If you have arrests or convictions in <span class="emphasisitalic">California only</span>, this is the only RAP sheet you will need. In order for the DOJ to release your RAP sheet, you are required to submit your fingerprints. Your fingerprints must be taken by a company called “Live Scan” (which has been specially approved by the DOJ and has locations all around California). You will also need to pay a $25 processing fee to the DOJ. </p>
        <p class="text">For a step-by-step explanation of how to get your DOJ RAP sheet, see APPENDIX A, on PG. 990.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Note:</strong> It can take up to 2 months (anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks) to get a copy of your DOJ RAP sheet, depending on how long your RAP sheet is (i.e., how much information it contains).<sup><a href="#footnote-2957" id="footnote-ref-2957">[2956]</a></sup> </p>
