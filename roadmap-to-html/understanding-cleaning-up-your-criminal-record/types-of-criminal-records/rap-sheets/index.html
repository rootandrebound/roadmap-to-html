            <p class="text">A RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) is the government’s official version of your criminal history, as recorded by local, state, and federal government agencies (such as courts, law enforcement, FBI, and other criminal justice agencies). It contains a list of every contact you have had with the criminal justice system, including: arrests, charges, convictions, acquittals, dismissals, pleas, sentences, and open warrants. </p>
            <p class="text">Your RAP sheet includes important information like the date of each arrest, which law enforcement agency arrested you, what offense(s) you were charged with, your case number (docket or indictment number), and—most important—the final outcome (disposition) of each case (for example, acquittal, conviction, plea bargain, sentence, or dismissal).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2919" id="footnote-ref-2919">[2918]</a></sup></sup> It’s also important to look out for errors (learn about common ones on PG. 923).</p>

          <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/types-of-criminal-records/rap-sheets/how-many-rap-sheets-do-i-have/">How many RAP sheets do I have?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you potentially have three different RAP sheets.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2920" id="footnote-ref-2920">[2919]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <ol class="text">Your county (local) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in that specific county <em>only</em>. If you have convictions in multiple counties, you will have a RAP sheet for each county.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your DOJ (state) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in all of California, but <em>only California</em>. This RAP sheet is kept by the California Department of Justice (DOJ).<sup><a href="#footnote-2921" id="footnote-ref-2921">[2920]</a></sup> Unless you are 100% positive that <em>all</em> of your arrests and convictions were in just one county, it’s a safer bet to get a copy of your DOJ (state) RAP sheet to make sure you know of everything about you in California.</ol>
            <h4 class="sidebox">What will my RAP sheet look like?</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">Looking at a RAP sheet can be confusing! RAP sheets have lots of numbers and abbreviations, so it’s not always clear what information it actually contains or if it is correct. To learn how to read and understand the information in your California RAP sheet, and to see a sample California RAP sheet, see APPENDIX CC, on PG. 1053. You can also ask a lawyer or a public defender to help you read and understand your RAP sheet.</p>
            <ol class="text">Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet lists any and all criminal justice involvement you’ve had in <em>any</em> state in the U.S., or with the federal government. This RAP sheet is produced by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI).<sup><a href="#footnote-2922" id="footnote-ref-2922">[2921]</a></sup> Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet is also called an <em>Identity History Summary</em>.</ol>
            <p class="text">See APPENDIX CC, on PG. 1053 for a sample RAP sheet.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your RAP sheet is confidential! <em>Unlike a background check</em>, your official government RAP sheets are <em>confidential</em>. This means that <em>most people</em>—<em>most</em> employers, private landlords, and average Joes—CANNOT see your RAP sheets. Only <em>certain people</em> under <em>certain circumstances</em> can see your RAP sheet—this includes <em>courts</em>, <em>law enforcement</em>, <em>government agencies</em>, and <em>special employers</em>.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2923" id="footnote-ref-2923">[2922]</a></sup></sup></strong> Of course, <em>YOU</em> always have a right to see your own RAP sheet. (For a complete list of who can see your RAP sheet, see PG. 932.) BUT: Even though <em>RAP sheets</em> are confidential, <em>some of the information</em> in them will likely show up in background checks. That’s why it’s important to know what information is in your RAP sheet, and to correct any errors. For more information about correcting mistakes in your RAP sheet, see PG. 928. For more information on background checks and what information can and can’t show up in them, see PG. 925.</p>

            <p class="text">There are 4 main reasons why it’s important to see your RAP sheet and know exactly what it says:</p>
            <ol class="text"><em>RAP sheets often contain mistakes</em>, such as incomplete or incorrect information. It’s important to <em>find and correct any errors </em>BEFORE the wrong information has a chance to harm you. </ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>You will have an accurate record of your criminal history</em>, so that you know what information certain employers, professional licensing agencies, landlords, banks, or others might see about you. To learn more about what information employers and licensing agencies CAN and CAN’T consider, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 551. To learn more about what information private landlords, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and owners of government-assisted housing CAN and CANNOT consider, see the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 328.</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>You will be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history</em>. If you know what is in your record, you can plan ahead and figure out how to talk about it in a more positive light. For more information about how to talk about your criminal history in a job interview, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 551.</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>It’s necessary for cleaning up your record</em>! Your RAP sheet will help you figure out which remedies you qualify for and which are the best options for you. In addition, you will need the details from your RAP sheet to fill out forms and complete the process of cleaning up your record.</ol>
            <p class="text">For more information on how to get a copy of your RAP sheet, see PG. 934.</p>
