        <h1>What does Prop. 47 not do?</h1>
        <p class="text">Prop. 47 <em>does not</em> give you back your gun rights if you lost these rights due to your conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3066" id="footnote-ref-3066">[3065]</a></sup> Prop. 47 also <em>does not</em> remove the conviction from your record; it simply reduces it to a lesser offense. </p>
        <p class="text">Also, please note that getting your felony conviction reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop. 47 does NOT give you any legal rights to be compensated for any time that you served that is more than what you could have been sentenced to if you had been convicted of a misdemeanor originally.</p>
        <p class="text">It used to be true that you could use excess custody credits to offset restitution fines, but the Legislature changed that section of the Penal Code in July 2013 to say that custody credits cannot be used to lower restitution fines.<sup><a href="#footnote-3067" id="footnote-ref-3067">[3066]</a></sup></p>
        <h3><a id="Expung_Part4_Prop47_HowChangesOffenses"></a><a id="EX_Prop47_HowChangesOffenses"></a><a id="_Toc352862220"></a>How does Prop. 47 change a conviction on my criminal record? </h3>
        <p class="text">Prop. 47 affects eligible offenses in the following ways:</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Shoplifting (Penal Code section 459.5)</span>‚ÄîProp. 47 adds a new offense, misdemeanor shoplifting. If you enter a business, during regular business hours and steal something worth less than $950, it is now shoplifting instead of second-degree burglary. If you are charged with shoplifting, now you cannot also be charged with petty theft or burglary. If you have a conviction for felony second-degree burglary (California Penal Code section 459), you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor shoplifting.</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery (Penal Code sections 470, 471, 472, 475)</span>‚ÄîProp. 47 changes the laws for several forgery offenses that previously could be charged as either misdemeanors or felonies. Now, all of these offenses are straight misdemeanors only. However, Prop. 47 does NOT apply if you are convicted of both forgery and identity theft (Cal. Penal Code section 530.5). If you have a felony conviction for an eligible forgery offense, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery/Writing Bad Checks (Penal Code section 476a)</span>‚ÄîProp. 47 changes this offense from a ‚Äúwobbler‚Äù to a straight misdemeanor if the amount of the check is less than $950. Beware, however, that Prop. 47 does not apply if you have three or more prior forgery convictions. If you have a felony conviction for writing a bad check, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Theft (Penal Code section 490.2)</span>‚ÄîBefore Prop. 47, an offense was classified as either GRAND THEFT (a felony) or PETTY THEFT (a misdemeanor) based on (1) the value of the property stolen, (2) the type of property stolen (i.e. guns or cars), OR (3) the manner in which the property was stolen (for example, from someone‚Äôs immediate possession). After Prop. 47, the offense is classified based ONLY on whether the value of the property is more or less than $950. So, now if you steal something that is worth less than $950, you can only be charged with misdemeanor petty theft, regardless of what type of property you took or how you took it. If you have a felony grand theft conviction, you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor petty theft. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Receiving Stolen Property (Penal Code Section 496)</span>‚ÄîProp. 47 changes this offense to a straight misdemeanor if the value of the stolen property is under $950. If you have a felony conviction for receiving stolen property, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petty Theft with a Prior (Penal Code Section 666)</span>‚ÄîBefore Prop. 47, if you were charged with petty theft and had three or more previous theft convictions, you could have been charged with a felony. Now, for most people, you cannot be charged with a felony for petty theft, no matter how many prior petty theft convictions you have. The only way that you can be charged with <em>felony</em> petty theft under section 666 now is if you are already excluded from Prop. 47 (see above for convictions that can exclude you), and you also have a previous conviction for petty theft, grand theft, elder financial abuse, joyriding, burglary, carjacking, robbery or felony receiving stolen property,<sup><a href="#footnote-3068" id="footnote-ref-3068">[3067]</a></sup> OR you are required to register as a sex offender. If you have a felony conviction for petty theft based on prior theft convictions, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Simple Drug Possession (Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 11350, 11357, &amp; 11377)</span>‚ÄîUnder Prop. 47, simple possession of pretty much any controlled substance is a straight misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-3069" id="footnote-ref-3069">[3068]</a></sup> If you have a felony conviction for simple drug possession, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
