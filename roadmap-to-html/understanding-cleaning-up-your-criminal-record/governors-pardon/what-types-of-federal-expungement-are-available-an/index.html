        <h1>What types of federal expungement are available, and how could they help me?</h1>
        <p class="text">Convictions for federal offenses (violations of U.S. law) often have consequences <em>beyond</em> California. Federal convictions cause you to lose your eligibility for government-assisted housing,<sup><a href="#footnote-3198" id="footnote-ref-3198">[3197]</a></sup> federal student loans,<sup><a href="#footnote-3199" id="footnote-ref-3199">[3198]</a></sup> and participating in foster care or adoption programs,<sup><a href="#footnote-3200" id="footnote-ref-3200">[3199]</a></sup> so getting them expunged can benefit you in (re)applying to these programs.</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Federal expungement &amp; dismissal:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">A <strong>federal expungement</strong> is different than an expungement under California law. Federal law allows for complete expungement of your conviction. The entire record of your conviction is completely erased along with any information associated with it. The offense is removed from your criminal record as if it never happened. This only applies in very limited situations, but it is a true expungement (see Situation 1). A <strong>federal dismissal</strong> is more like a California expungement, in that the conviction is NOT completely erased from your record, but it is still hidden from public view (see Situation 2).</p>
        <p class="text">Unfortunately, most federal convictions <em>cannot be expunged or dismissed</em>. Unlike in California (and most other states), there is NO general federal law that offers expungements for federal crimes. However, there are a few federal laws that offer expungements<strong> </strong>and dismissals<strong> i</strong>n certain limited situations.</p>
        <p class="text">Here are the limited options that exist for “cleaning up” federal convictions on your record:</p>
        <ol class="text">If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>UNDER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal expungement.<em> (See Situation 1, below.)</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>OVER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal <em>dismissal</em>, but not an expungement.<em> (See Situation 2, below).</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">It is<em> possible</em> but <em>very difficult</em> to get your conviction expunged by a federal judge (this is called a <em>judicial expungement</em>). <em>(See Situation 3, below).</em></ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862275"></a>Who can get a federal expungement or dismissal? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you have a federal drug conviction (see <em>Situation 1 or 2 in the next question</em>), you may qualify for an expungement or dismissal of your conviction if ALL of the following are true:</p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>You were convicted of only one drug-related offense. </strong></ol>
        <ol class="text">You are NOT eligible if you have <em>any</em> other drug-related convictions (state or federal), OR if you have had any previous drug convictions expunged under the statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-3201" id="footnote-ref-3201">[3200]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>You were in possession of only <em>certain</em> types of drugs. </strong></ol>
        <ol class="text">The federal expungement statute ONLY covers convictions for marijuana, cocaine and cocaine-based substances, heroine, and methamphetamines (along with a few other less common drugs). To be eligible, your conviction must have involved one of these drugs (NOT any other drug).<sup><a href="#footnote-3202" id="footnote-ref-3202">[3201]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>You were convicted of “simple possession” only. </strong></ol>
        <ol class="text">You are NOT eligible if your conviction was for <em>any other offense</em> besides possession of a small amount of drugs consistent with personal use. This means no sales, transportation, or distribution offenses will qualify.<sup><a href="#footnote-3203" id="footnote-ref-3203">[3202]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>The judge “suspended” entry of judgment of conviction for the offense. </strong></ol>
        <ol class="text">This means that you were found guilty of the offense, but the judge basically put your conviction <em>on hold</em>, and did not enter it into the official record. (This is to give you a chance to complete probation or a treatment program instead of going to prison.);</ol>
        <ol class="text">The judge put you on probation for <em>no more than 1 year</em>; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You successfully completed probation with NO violations.</ol>
