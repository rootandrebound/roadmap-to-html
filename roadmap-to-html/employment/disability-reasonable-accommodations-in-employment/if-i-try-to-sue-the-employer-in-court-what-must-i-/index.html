        <h1>If I try to sue the employer in court, what must I prove?</h1>
        <p class="text">To sue an employer under the federal ADA (FHA), California‚Äôs Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California‚Äôs Unruh Civil Rights Act),<sup><a href="#footnote-2038" id="footnote-ref-2038">[2037]</a></sup> you must show that your status as an individual with a disability was a motivating factor in the employer‚Äôs decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.<sup><a href="#footnote-2039" id="footnote-ref-2039">[2038]</a></sup> You must also provide evidence that your disability substantially limited your ability to live a normal life,<sup><a href="#footnote-2040" id="footnote-ref-2040">[2039]</a></sup> that the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary, and (for a disability related to substance abuse) that you are not currently using illegal drugs.<sup> </sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2041" id="footnote-ref-2041">[2040]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Remember, you CANNOT sue an employer in court until AFTER you‚Äôve filed a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH and received a Right-to-Sue notice.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>BE PREPARED:</strong> You should be prepared for the employer to argue that you do NOT have a protected disability because you are a ‚Äúcurrent user‚Äù of illegal drugs, or that you are not being treated for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2042" id="footnote-ref-2042">[2041]</a></sup></sup> You can support your request by providing treatment records showing that you have not used drugs for a significant period of time, or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2043" id="footnote-ref-2043">[2042]</a></sup></sup> You should also provide evidence of your participation in or completion of a drug abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.</p>

        <li id="footnote-2039"><p>See Head v. Glacier Nw. Inc., 413 F.3d 1053 (2005) (holding that the ADA outlaws adverse employment decisions motivated, even in part, by animus based on a plaintiff‚Äôs disability or request for an accommodation).  <a href="#footnote-ref-2039">‚Üë</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-2040"><p> 42 U.S.C. ¬ß¬†12102(2)(A) (defining disability as ‚Äúa physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more .¬†.¬†. major life activities‚Äù). There are many ways to prove that alcohol/drug addiction substantially limited one or more major life activities. For example, you could testify (speak in court) or write an affidavit (legal letter) about how your own addiction, at one time, made you unable to care for yourself or your family, or substantially limited one or more major body functions. You could also provide affidavits or testimony of family members or others. It is not necessary to provide evidence from a treatment program, though that certainly can be helpful. <a href="#footnote-ref-2040">‚Üë</a></p></li>
