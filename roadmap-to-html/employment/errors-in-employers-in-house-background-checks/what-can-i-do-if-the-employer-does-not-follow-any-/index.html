        <h1>What can I do if the employer does not follow any of these rules on background checks?</h1>
        <p class="text">Employers that do not follow federal and state laws for conducting background checks on you may be liable to you and to the government for their illegal actions.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSSome ways an employer can violate background check laws: </h4>
        <ul class="textbox">Ordering a background check without your permission;Failing to inform you of your rights in a timely way;Not giving you notice of an adverse action (i.e. deciding not to hire you) BEFORE taking the action against youNot providing you with a copy of your background check report:if you requested a copy of the report when giving permission to run the background check, and/orif before taking any adverse action against you.Asking you for a copy of your RAP sheet OR making you get fingerprinted (including Live Scan)—except in a few limited situations (e.g., public employers; occupational licensing agencies; and certain private employers if the job involves working with children, elderly, or disabled, or gives you access to sensitive information). To learn which employers can access your RAP sheet or fingerprints, see PG. 577.Making YOU prove that you do NOT have a record.</ul>
        <p class="text">If you believe that an employer has violated the law for any reason, you may want to take the following steps, if possible:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you want to sue the employer—BEWARE!<em>(1) It’s expensive.</em> Suing an employer will likely cost a LOT of time and money, and your recovery options are limited.<em>(2) No frivolous lawsuits are allowed. </em>The Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) includes a penalty for filing a lawsuit or related court papers that are filed in “bad faith or for purposes of harassment.” You may have to pay the other side’s attorney’s fees, along with your own, if you file a lawsuit to harass an employer and lose. </p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Talk to the employer.</span> The first thing you can do is try to talk to the employer directly. Simply bringing the matter to the employer’s attention may be all that it takes to solve the problem, especially if the employer just didn’t know it was violating the law.<sup><a href="#footnote-1921" id="footnote-ref-1921">[1920]</a></sup> Explain the law and give the employer the chance to change his/her behavior. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Report the employer to the Attorney General</span>. If talking to the employer directly does not work, you can report the employer to the California Attorney General. The Attorney General will then investigate your claim and try to resolve it. You can report your claim by calling the Attorney General’s Office of Public Inquiry Unit at (916) 322-3360 or toll free at 1-800-952-5225. You can also send a written complaint to:</ol>
        <p class="text">Attorney General's Office <br/>California Department of Justice <br/>Attn: Public Inquiry Unit <br/>P.O. Box 944255 <br/>Sacramento, CA 94244-2550</p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Report the employer to the FTC.</span> If the employer has violated federal background check laws, you can report the employer directly to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC has the authority to force employers to comply with background check laws<sup><a href="#footnote-1922" id="footnote-ref-1922">[1921]</a></sup> by requesting a court order to stop the employer from violating the law, or by filing a lawsuit against the employer. To file a complaint with the FTC, call the agency directly at 1-877-382-4357.<sup><a href="#footnote-1923" id="footnote-ref-1923">[1922]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Sue the employer in state or federal court.</span> You can file a lawsuit against an employer in either state or federal court for violating background check laws. You may be able to get a court to order the employer to stop violating the law and/or pay you money. For more information about suing the employer, talk to a lawyer first!</ol>
