        <h1>What can I do if a background check company has broken the law?</h1>
        <p class="text">Generally, if you believe that a background check company has violated the law in conducting a background check on you, you can take the following actions:</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Contact the background check company</span><sup><a href="#footnote-1841" id="footnote-ref-1841">[1841]</a></sup>—First, you can contact the background check company directly to demand that it complies with the law. This is especially important because most violations by background check companies involve the nature of the information that the agency has provided. Contacting the agency directly is the quickest and most efficient way to clear harmful information from your background check. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Report the background check company to the Attorney General</span>—If contacting the background check company directly does not solve the problem, you can report the agency to the California Attorney General. The Attorney General will investigate your claim and try to resolve it. You can report your claim by calling the Attorney General’s Office of Public Inquiry Unit at (916) 322-3360 or toll free at 1-800-952-5225. You can also send a written complaint to: Attorney General's Office, California Department of Justice, Attn: Public Inquiry Unit, P.O. Box 944255, Sacramento, CA 94244-2550</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Report the background check company to the FTC</span>—<strong>If the </strong>background check company has violated federal background check laws, you can report the background check company directly to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC has the authority to force background check companies to comply with background check laws<sup><a href="#footnote-1842" id="footnote-ref-1842">[1842]</a></sup> by requesting a court order to stop the agency from violating the law, or by filing a lawsuit against the agency. To file a complaint with the FTC, call the agency directly at 1-877-382-4357.<sup><a href="#footnote-1843" id="footnote-ref-1843">[1843]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Sue the background check company in state or federal court</span><sup><a href="#footnote-1844" id="footnote-ref-1844">[1844]</a></sup>—You can file a lawsuit against the background check company in either state or federal court for violating background check laws. You may be able to get a court to order the background check company to stop violating the law and/or pay you money.</ol>

        <h2>HOW EMPLOYERS CAN (&amp; CAN’T) USE YOUR CRIMINAL HISTORY</h2>
        <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">How employers CAN and CAN’T discriminate against you based on your criminal recordWhat employers CAN, CAN’T, and SHOULD consider about your criminal recordWhat laws protect people with criminal records against discriminationDifferent types of illegal discrimination related to your criminal recordWhat you can do if an employer illegally discriminates against you, and how to file a discrimination complaintThe different government civil rights agencies that protect your rights against illegal discriminationWhat kind of remedies you may be able to get if an employer illegally discriminates against youHow to locate an attorney, government civil agency, or non-profit organization to help you if you think an employer illegally discriminated against you</ul>
        <p class="text">This section will explain the laws on how employers can (and can’t) use your criminal history to make employment decisions, and what you can do if you think an employer has illegally discriminated against you. </p>
        <p class="text">In general, the law says that employers should only consider your criminal history if it directly relates to your ability to do the job, and cannot use your criminal record to discriminate based on your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. However, there is often a gap between what the law says on paper—about your rights as a job applicant or employee, and about the employer’s duties to treat you fairly—and how employers act in real life. It can also be difficult to <em>prove</em> that an employer has illegally discriminated against you, which can make it difficult to enforce your rights. But it is IMPORTANT for you to know what your rights are on paper, and know how to spot illegal discrimination and protect yourself from illegal practices as much as possible.</p>
