        <h1>If the employer asks you directly about your criminal record</h1>
        <p class="text">An employer might ask about your criminal record in writing, on a job application, or in an interview. This section discusses all of these situations. It’s important to know your rights:</p>
        <ol class="text">There are limitations to WHAT an employer can ask about and learn from you by asking, either on an application or in an in-person interview.</ol>
        <ol class="text">There are also limitations on WHEN an employer can ask you about certain information—they cannot ask you everything up front! </ol>
        <p class="text">These laws are meant to protect you from discrimination as you apply for jobs.</p>

          <h2><a href="/employment/your-rights-against-employers/if-the-employer-asks-you-directly-about-your-crimi/what-cant-employers-ask-about-my-criminal-record/">What can’t employers ask about my criminal record?</a></h2>
            <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTPublic vs. Private Employers</h4>
            <p class="textbox">Public (government) employers can ask and get access to more information than private companies or nonprofit organizations. Read carefully to understand what laws apply to public vs. private employers.</p>
            <p class="text">There are certain parts of your criminal record that employers CANNOT legally ask you about. Under state law, an employer cannot ask you about:</p>
            <ol class="text"><em>Convictions that have been sealed, dismissed, expunged, or statutorily eradicated.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1841" id="footnote-ref-1841">[1840]</a></sup> A private employer cannot ask a question like, “Have you ever been convicted of any crimes that were dismissed?” And if a private employer asks about these convictions, you don’t have to report ones that were expunged/dismissed.</ol>
            <h4 class="sidebox">HOW COMMON ARE BACKGROUND CHECKS?</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">About 69% of employers run criminal history background checks on all job applicants. About 86% of employers conduct background checks on at least some applicants. Larger companies tend to run routine background on everyone as part of their regular job application process, while smaller companies might not.</p>
            <ol class="text">EXCEPTION: On the other hand, public (government) employers and law enforcement agencies can request more information about dismissed records from you than private employers.<sup><a href="#footnote-1842" id="footnote-ref-1842">[1841]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>Convictions for minor marijuana-related offenses, if the conviction is over 2 years old.</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1843" id="footnote-ref-1843">[1842]</a></sup></sup> Minor marijuana-related convictions over 2 years old that an employer CANNOT ask about include, but are not limited to:</ol>
            <ol class="text">Marijuana possession (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1844" id="footnote-ref-1844">[1843]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Carrying or giving away small amounts of marijuana (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1845" id="footnote-ref-1845">[1844]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Having a pipe, bong, or other device for illegally smoking marijuana.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1846" id="footnote-ref-1846">[1845]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Being in a room, car, or other location with someone who is illegally using or smoking marijuana, and helping them to do it.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1847" id="footnote-ref-1847">[1846]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Unlawfully being under the influence of marijuana (in other words, being <em>high</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1848" id="footnote-ref-1848">[1847]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>Arrests that did not lead to a conviction.</em> Employers (private and most public employers) CANNOT ask about past arrests where you were not convicted of the alleged crime. This includes arrests where the charges against you were never brought, charges were dismissed, and cases where you were found not guilty. THERE ARE 3 EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE YOU SHOULD KNOW:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1849" id="footnote-ref-1849">[1848]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">First, private and public employers can still ask about recent arrests that are pending or unresolved (for example, if you were arrested, posted bail money, and are awaiting trial, the arrest is still considered pending, and employers can learn out about those). PLEASE NOTE: If you live in a city or county that has “banned the box,” the rule for when employers can ask about pending arrests is different. See PG. 566 for more information about when an employer can ask.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Second, law enforcement employers can ask about and consider all arrests.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Third, health care facilities and pharmacy employers can ask about and consider CERTAIN arrests (for drug and/or sexual offenses) if you are applying for a job with regular access to drugs or medications (for drug arrests), or to patients (for sexual offense arrests).</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>Arrests that led to the completion of a court diversion program.</em> A court diversion program (such as a drug rehabilitation program) helps a person charged with certain crimes avoid criminal charges—and therefore avoid a criminal record. By law, employers are NOT allowed to ask for any information about your participation in a court diversion program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1850" id="footnote-ref-1850">[1849]</a></sup> </ol>
            <h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Convictions More Than 7 Years Old</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">There is a weird gap in the law that you should know about. While employers CAN ask about and consider convictions older than 7 years old (and can ask you about these as part of an in-house background check), private background check companies CANNOT report information about convictions more than 7 years old on your background check report. This CANNOT come up in a background check.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: In general, if an employer asks you if you were ever arrested, you SHOULD NOT answer that question, and you DO NOT have to. Politely remind the employer that if he/she wants to learn about your criminal record, he/she can ask ONLY about relevant convictions—NOT arrests—to protect your rights.<strong> </strong></p>

            <p class="text">Under state law, employers can ask you questions about certain convictions, but not all.<sup><a href="#footnote-1851" id="footnote-ref-1851">[1850]</a></sup> For example, an employer could ask (on an application or in person): “Have you ever been convicted of a crime?”—but if the employer is following the law, there should be a big warning that says it’s NOT asking you to report convictions you don’t legally have to admit (all those listed, starting on PG. 566).<sup><a href="#footnote-1852" id="footnote-ref-1852">[1851]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">Employers can also ask you direct questions about pending arrests and ongoing/ unresolved cases. For example, and employer could ask (on paper or in-person), “Do you have any pending arrests or unresolved criminal cases?”</p>

            <p class="text">Unfortunately, the answer is complicated because the rules are not the same for all types of employers, and vary between some counties and cities. <em>When</em> a California employer can ask about your criminal record depends on the following factors:</p>
            <h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Pending arrests</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">An employer can only ask about arrests and charges that are open or unresolved, NOT about arrests or charges that were dismissed or closed in your favor.</p>
            <ol class="text">Whether it’s a public (state or local government) or private employer, AND</ol>
            <ol class="text">For private employers, what county and city it operates in.</ol>
            <p class="text">Because of these differences, this section is divided into rules for <em>public (government) employers</em> and rules for <em>private employers</em>. </p>
          </article>
        
          <article>
          <h2><a href="/employment/your-rights-against-employers/if-the-employer-asks-you-directly-about-your-crimi/when-can-a-public-government-employer-in-californi/">When can a public (government) employer in California ask about my criminal record?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Because of the recent state law known as “Ban the Box,” public employers in California CANNOT ask you—in-person, verbally, or in writing on a job application—ANY information about your conviction history until AFTER the employer has determined that you meet the minimum job requirements. This law applies statewide to ALL state and local government employers, but does NOT apply to <em>federal government jobs</em>, <em>jobs with law enforcement, or positions that require a criminal background check by law</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1853" id="footnote-ref-1853">[1852]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="textbox"><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong> The current interpretation of California's "Ban the Box" law is that it does <em>not</em> apply to community colleges in their function as state employers, meaning that they are legally allowed to ask you <em>certain questions </em>about your criminal record in the initial application—but nothing from the list of “never-ask” criminal background questions starting on PG. 566).</p>
            <p class="text">Some cities and counties in California (such as San Francisco, Richmond, Los Angeles and Compton) have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws that sometimes apply to certain private employers. See Appendix F, PG. 621, for more information about local “Ban the Box” laws in California (such as the one in San Francisco called the “Fair Chance Ordinance”).</p>
            <li id="footnote-1853"><p> Cal. Lab. Code § 432.9.  <a href="#footnote-ref-1853">↑</a></p></li>

          <h2><a href="/employment/your-rights-against-employers/if-the-employer-asks-you-directly-about-your-crimi/when-can-a-private-employer-in-california-ask-abou/">When can a private employer in California ask about my criminal record?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">It depends on your city and county. For many years, across the entire state, a private employer could ask certain questions about your criminal record at any time, and most private employers can still ask these questions AT ANY TIME. </p>
            <p class="text">Recently, however, San Francisco passed a “Ban the Box” law that applies to private employers. This means that in SF, employers must wait to ask about records until AFTER they have determined the person would be qualified, just like public employers must around the state. For now, San Francisco is the ONLY county in which “Ban the Box” legislation applies to private employers, but other cities and counties are considering similar legislation. See Appendix G, PG. 623, for a full explanation of the San Francisco law, called the Fair Chance Ordinance. A similar law that applies to private employers located or doing business in the City of Los Angeles passed in December 2016. See Appendix W, PG. 649, for more information about Los Angeles’ Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring.</p>
            <p class="text">In addition, the cities of Richmond, Compton, and Los Angeles have implemented “Ban the Box” laws that apply to government contractors—meaning private employers that have contracts with the local city government. If you are applying to a job with a private contractor in one of those cities, you should find out if “Ban the Box” would apply to you. See Appendix H, PG. 626 to learn about Richmond, CA’s “Ban the Box” law and PG. 649 to learn about the one in Los Angeles.</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">SUmmaryKNOW YOUR RIGHTS: What Employers Can Ask You &amp; When</h4>
            <ul class="textbox">In general, employers CANNOT ask about: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions.Employers CAN ask about: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases.In general, PUBLIC employers can only ask about your record AFTER they decide that you meet the basic job qualifications.In general, PRIVATE employers can ask about your record at any time. “Ban the Box” laws you more rights and protections if you apply for a job with a state or local government agency, and/or in certain local cities and counties.</ul>
