        <h1>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h1>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf an employer tells me that they will run a background check, should I still apply for the job?</h4>
        <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisheavy">Yes! </span>Even if the employer does run a background check, this doesn’t mean that they won’t hire you. 58% of employers allow job applicants to explain the results of their background check before the employer makes a final decision about whether or not to hire them. See PG. 558 above for some tips on how to discuss your background and record in the most favorable way—showing the employer why s/he should hire you and give you a chance!</p>
        <p class="text">Generally, no. Employers CANNOT look at your credit report unless you are applying for certain high level or sensitive job positions, such as a manager or supervisor within a company, a law enforcement officer, or a position with access to large amounts of cash and/or sensitive financial information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1855" id="footnote-ref-1855">[1854]</a></sup> If you have further questions about your credit history, contact a local legal service organization or call 2-1-1.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSYour Rights If An Employer Runs A Background Check</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>
