        <h1>Real-life situations—examples of discrimination because of criminal record & race (or other protected characteristic)</h1>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In real life, discrimination based on your criminal record doesn’t always happen alone—it may also happen in combination with racial discrimination or other illegal discrimination based on your protected class. For example, if an employer decides not to hire you due to your criminal record AND your race, this would be ILLEGAL racial discrimination.</p>
