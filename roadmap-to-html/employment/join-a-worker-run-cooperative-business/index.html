        <h1>Join a worker-run cooperative business</h1>
        <p class="text">A worker cooperative is a business that is owned and controlled by its workers. In other words, the workers are both the employees AND the employer. Usually, workers run the day-to-day operations of the business‚Äîsuch as making business decisions, assigning tasks to each person, etc., as well as the business‚Äôs finances. Although each person has a different level of responsibility, all workers are considered to be equal members and have equal power within the business.</p>
        <p class="text">Any business can be a worker-owned and controlled cooperative. Worker co-ops have been successful in many different industries. Some examples are:</p>
        <ol class="text">Service‚Äîhousecleaning, day labor, restaurants, taxis, childcare</ol>
        <ol class="text">Farming and food production‚Äîurban or community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, bakeries, restaurants</ol>
        <ol class="text">Retail‚Äîgrocery stores, bookstores, bike shops</ol>
        <ol class="text">Health care‚Äînursing, home health care, clinics, bodywork</ol>
        <ol class="text">Skilled trades‚Äîprinting, plumbing, woodworking, contracting</ol>
        <ol class="text">Manufacturing and engineering‚Äîmachine parts, fabricating</ol>
        <ol class="text">Technology‚Äîweb hosting, networking, voice and data systems</ol>
        <ol class="text">Education‚Äîcharter schools, teacher/student/parent-run schools</ol>
        <ol class="text">Media and the arts‚Äîdesigners, galleries, performers, publishers</ol>
