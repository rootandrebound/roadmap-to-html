        <h1>What can I do if the board denies my application for a license?</h1>
        <p class="text"><strong>You can appeal your denial! </strong>Many applications are denied because of past convictions , but are successful on appeal. There are also some legal aid attorneys and clinics that may be able to help you appeal (see a list of legal aid organizaitons on PG. 1075). Generally, you have the right to appeal the board’s denial and have an administrative hearing before a <em>neutral administrative law judge</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2013" id="footnote-ref-2013">[2012]</a></sup> At the hearing, you have the right to present evidence of your rehabilitation and argue your case for why you deserve a license.<sup><a href="#footnote-2014" id="footnote-ref-2014">[2013]</a></sup> For a general overview of what the appeals process is like, see Appendix Q, PG. 640.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861739"></a>What can I do if I used to have a license, but lost it due to a criminal conviction? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you previously had a professional license, your license may have been revoked (permanently taken away) or suspended (temporarily taken away) because of your criminal conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2015" id="footnote-ref-2015">[2014]</a></sup> In this case, you generally have the right to ask the licensing board to reinstate (re-issue) your license to you, or to reduce your penalty and return your license sooner.<sup><a href="#footnote-2016" id="footnote-ref-2016">[2015]</a></sup> To do this, you must first wait at least 1 year from the date your license was taken away, and then submit special forms (a petition) and other documents to the licensing board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2017" id="footnote-ref-2017">[2016]</a></sup> Each licensing board may also have different or additional requirements, such as completing your term of probation or parole first, before you can ask for your license to be returned.<sup><a href="#footnote-2018" id="footnote-ref-2018">[2017]</a></sup> (Note: Although you can apply to have your license reinstated while you are still incarcerated, you are unlikely to be successful if you apply while you’re still inside.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2019" id="footnote-ref-2019">[2018]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">The licensing board will give you a chance to present your reasons for why your license should be returned or reissued. This may be during a hearing, or by sending in a written statement. The Attorney General will also have a chance to argue for why your license should not be returned.<sup><a href="#footnote-2020" id="footnote-ref-2020">[2019]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">In order to get your license back, you will generally need to prove that you have been rehabilitated since your offense<sup><a href="#footnote-2021" id="footnote-ref-2021">[2020]</a></sup>—particularly since you were released from prison or jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-2022" id="footnote-ref-2022">[2021]</a></sup> This means showing that you have changed your life for the better, taken steps to improve yourself and correct previous bad habits, and successfully completed the requirements of your sentence. The board may also consider the nature and severity of the offense, how much time has passed since the conviction, whether the conviction has been dismissed, any other convictions on your record, and letters of recommendation or good character from people who know you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2023" id="footnote-ref-2023">[2022]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861740"></a>Who can help me if my license has been denied or taken away due to a criminal conviction? </h3>
        <p class="text">There are some non-profit organizations that may be able to help if your license has been denied or taken away due to a criminal conviction. These are just a few examples of organizations that can help, but there may be others in your area:</p>
