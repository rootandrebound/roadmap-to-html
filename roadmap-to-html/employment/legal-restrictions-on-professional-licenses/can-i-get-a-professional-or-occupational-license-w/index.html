        <h1>Can I get a professional or occupational license with a record?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on what type of license you are trying to get, what conviction(s) you have on your record, and what rehabilitation efforts you have participated in. </p>
        <p class="text">Some professional/occupational licenses have extremely strict rules about criminal records, while other types of licenses are more lenient. It is best to check with the licensing board for the profession you want to enter to find out its current criteria.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint: you can Appeal a license denial</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Professional and occupational licenses are often denied due to past convictions, but don‚Äôt be discouraged! You can appeal a denial and advocate for yourself on appeal. There are also legal aid and reentry attorneys who may be able to help you appeal!</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861734"></a>What criminal history information can a licensing board consider about me? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox"><em>Submit a Pre-Approval Application When Possible</em>The Board of Barbering &amp; Cosmetology has a special early application process for people with criminal convictions who want to apply for a license. You can submit an initial application and find out ahead of time whether you will be able to get a license, before you go through any training or pay any fees.<span class="emphasisitalic">Note</span>: You will still have to complete all of the training and examination requirements, in order to get your actual license.</p>
        <p class="text">When you apply for a professional license, the licensing board can see your entire record‚Äîincluding convictions that have been ‚Äúexpunged.‚Äù (Note: Regular employers generally CANNOT see expunged convictions‚Äîbut licensing boards are different.) However, the board cannot deny your licenses based ONLY on the fact that you have a conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2001" id="footnote-ref-2001">[2000]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Beyond criminal history information, licensing boards MUST also consider <em>mitigating and rehabilitative evidence</em>. <em>Mitigating evidence</em> is information that would make the board judge a conviction less harshly, and could be information like youth, drug addiction, duress, or other factors that were going on at the time of the offense. <em>Rehabiliative evidence</em> is proof of your efforts to change and improve yourself, demonstrating that you are no longer at risk of the conduct or circumstances that led to your past system involvement. You can submit this evidence at the time of your application, and on appeal.</p>
