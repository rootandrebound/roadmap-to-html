        <h1>How do I get a replacement card while I am incarcerated?</h1>
        <p class="text">The process for requesting a replacement card while you are still incarcerated is fairly straightforward. However, due to conflicting rules and practices within the Social Security Administration (SSA), it’s hard to say whether you will be successful or not. You should try anyway. <em>Here is what may affect your request:</em></p>
        <ol class="text"><strong><em>The facility you are in: </em>Where you are incarcerated may affect your ability to get an SSC while you are still incarcerated.</strong></ol>
        <ol class="text"><a id="MOUs_SSA"></a><strong><em>MOUs:</em></strong> Official policy states that before the SSA will accept “certification” (proof) of your identity from a correctional facility in order to get your SSN, that correctional facility must enter into a special formal agreement with the SSA called a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The purpose of the MOU is to ensure that the corrections officials follow the same strict procedures and requirements as the SSA officials do when they verify people’s identities. If your facility has an MOU with the SSA, the SSA will accept the facility’s certification that you are who you say you are as proof of your identity. However, not all state corrections agencies or facilities have MOU agreements with the SSA. If your facility does not have a current, valid, signed MOU with the SSA, the SSA field office reviewer that evaluates your application cannot accept a certification from the facility as a 100% proof of your identity. If your facility does not have an MOU with the SSA, then its certification carries less weight, and your application for a replacement Social Security Card is more likely to get denied.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong><em>Your local Field Office/Reviewer:</em> The practices of your local Field Office in reviewing applications from incarcerated people will affect your ability to get a Social Security Card while you are incarcerated.</strong></ol>
        <ol class="text">If your facility does <em>not</em> have an MOU with the SSA, the local Field Office should still evaluate your application as it would any other application.<sup><a href="#footnote-45" id="footnote-ref-45">[45]</a></sup> This means that your reviewer can <em>consider</em> the certification, but can’t <em>rely</em> on it 100%. How much weight your reviewer gives to the certification will depend on that field office’s practices. Some field offices accept certifications without hassle; others do not. It’s always worth a try!</ol>
