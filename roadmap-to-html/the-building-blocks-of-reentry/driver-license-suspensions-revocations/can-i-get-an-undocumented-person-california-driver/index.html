        <h1>Can I get an ‚ÄúUndocumented Person‚Äù California driver license?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you are an undocumented immigrant, but otherwise meet the requirements to drive legally in California, you may be able to get an AB 60 ‚ÄúUndocumented Person‚Äù driver license. It is very important to know that the AB 60 driver license is NOT an official form of ID because it does <em>not</em> qualify you for employment, voter registration, or public benefits in the United States. HOWEVER, an AB 60 driver license <em>will</em> allow you to drive a car legally in California‚Äîand California only.<sup><a href="#footnote-202" id="footnote-ref-202">[201]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Proof of Residency:</em> </strong>When applying for an AB 60 license, you will need to submit proof that you currently live in California. For a list of documents that meet this requirement, see Appendix¬†H, PG.¬†103.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860928"></a>Can the police report me to U.S. immigration officials for using an AB 60 ‚ÄúUndocumented Person‚Äù driver license in California? </h3>
        <p class="text">No. It is against state law for state police to discriminate against anyone driving with an AB 60 driver license in California, but <strong><em>federal agents in California and all law enforcement agencies outside of California</em></strong> are NOT required to honor your AB 60 driver license. </p>
        <p class="text">Depending on local laws and policies, you could face criminal or immigration consequences if you show your California ‚ÄúUndocumented Person‚Äù driver license to a police officer in another state‚Äîso use it <em>only in California</em>! And do NOT try to use it in federal facilities, like airport screenings or crossing through Customs and Border Patrols!<sup><a href="#footnote-203" id="footnote-ref-203">[202]</a></sup> Airports and Customs are run by the federal government, and they do NOT recognize AB 60 licenses‚Äîin fact, they can use it against you.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860929"></a>Whate are the other limited forms of ID for undocumented people? </h3>
        <p class="text">You may be able to get one of these limited forms of ID, which can be used for some but not all purposes:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Consular Identification Cards (CIDs):</strong> Some governments issue CID cards to identify their citizens who are living in foreign countries. CID cards can be issued to people who are undocumented or documented in the foreign county. See Appendix¬†I, PG.¬†109, for a list of countries that issue CIDs. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, visit the nearest consulate to obtain your CID card. In the United States, CID cards can be a helpful ID document as you try to get a driver license, open a bank account, show proof of identity to police, and access other services. For example, in California, you can use a Mexican CID to get a driver license. However, CIDs do not grant you legal presence in the United States or other privileges.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-204" id="footnote-ref-204">[203]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Municipal IDs:</strong> A handful of California cities have begun issuing municipal (‚Äúcity‚Äù) ID cards for their residents. You can use these to get access to city services and benefits. More importantly, they are considered a form of identification by local officials and may provide evidence to get other forms of ID. Additionally, these forms of ID do not require proof of citizenship or legal presence of any kind.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>San Francisco City ID Card ‚Äî </em></strong>Photo ID card for San Francisco residents to get access to city programs and connect to local businesses. It proves identity and city residency; and it can be used as a public library card and to access other city services. For more information, visit the San Francisco County Clerk‚Äôs website at: <a href="http://www.sfgov2.org/index.aspx?page=110">http://www.sfgov2.org/index.aspx?page=110</a>, or call 2-1-1 in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Oakland City ID Prepaid Mastercard ‚Äî </em></strong>Photo ID with an optional Prepaid Debit¬†Card banking feature for Oakland residents. For Oakland residents who don‚Äôt have bank¬†accounts, it provides an affordable alternative. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.oaklandcityid.com/">http://www.oaklandcityid.com/</a> or call 1-888-997-3522.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Richmond City ID Card ‚Äî </em></strong>Photo ID and prepaid debit card for Richmond residents. For more information, see <a href="http://www.richmondcityid.com/">http://www.richmondcityid.com/</a> or call 1-888-997-3522.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860930"></a>What other resources are there for undocumented people and immigrants in California? </h3>
        <p class="text">For more information on what it means to be an undocumented person in the United States, you can contact a referral and information hotline such as 1-888-6-CHIRLA (1-888-624-4752), provided in English and Spanish by the <em>Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles</em>. The hotline is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and can provide direct services or refer you to other organizations that can help you. It is safe for non-citizens and undocumented people to call this hotline. </p>
