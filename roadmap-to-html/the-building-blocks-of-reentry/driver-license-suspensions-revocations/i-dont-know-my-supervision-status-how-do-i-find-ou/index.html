        <h1>I don‚Äôt know my supervision status. How do I find out?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you are unaware or unsure of your supervision status, talk to your supervising officer or your public defender/defense attorney and ask what type it is. Tell them you are trying to determine if you can vote. Feel free to bring this chart with you.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860950"></a>What could happen if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? </h3>
        <p class="text">It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election when you weren‚Äôt legally allowed to, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. Voter fraud requires ‚Äúspecific intent.‚Äù<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-249" id="footnote-ref-249">[248]</a></sup></sup> This means that when you voted, you knew that you were illegally voting, and voted with the purpose of breaking the law. If you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election when you had no legal right to do so, you could be found guilty of voter fraud.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-250" id="footnote-ref-250">[249]</a></sup></sup> The punishment can be up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. That said, voter fraud is usually only prosecuted when large numbers of people have committed the crime in a way that affects an election‚Äôs outcome.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-251" id="footnote-ref-251">[250]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="Voting_HowToRegister"></a><a id="_Toc352860951"></a>Registering to Vote in California: </h2>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860952"></a>I want to vote in the next election. When is the last day I can register to vote in California? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">CAN I USE MY PRISON ID TO VOTE?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Although a prison ID isn‚Äôt explicitly listed as acceptable ID, the law does allow a ‚Äúdocument issued by a government agency‚Äù to prove who you are. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, ¬ß¬†20107(d)(2)(E).) Your prison ID was issued by a government agency (either CDCR or the Bureau of Prisons), so it <em>should </em>be accepted as ID. However, since volunteers who work at polling stations on election day are not legal experts, you might have difficulties getting your prison ID accepted and may need to speak with a few different people. Remember: you won‚Äôt need your prison ID card at all if you provided a SSN, driver license number, or state ID number when you registered.</p>
        <p class="text">The deadline to register is 15 days <em>before</em> the next local, state, or federal election. You must submit the voter registration application form before midnight on the deadline.</p>
        <ol class="text">If you register using the online form, the timestamp must be before midnight on the deadline date (by 11:59 p.m.).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you register using a paper form, it must be postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election. (See PG.¬†70 to learn how to find your county elections office).<sup><a href="#footnote-252" id="footnote-ref-252">[251]</a></sup></ol>
