        <h1>If my license was suspended or revoked, could I get my driving privileges back?</h1>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Unless your license was <em>permanently </em>revoked, you should be able to regain your driving privileges if (1) the required time period of your suspension or revocation has passed, AND (2)¬†you‚Äôve fulfilled any conditions of your suspension or revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-160" id="footnote-ref-160">[159]</a></sup> Depending on the reason why your license was suspended, the length of suspension will vary, and the steps you must take to get your license back will also vary.<sup><a href="#footnote-161" id="footnote-ref-161">[160]</a></sup> If your Driver License was suspended or revoked and you want to regain your driving privileges, here are some steps you can take:<sup><a href="#footnote-162" id="footnote-ref-162">[161]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="step">Know the details of your situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-163" id="footnote-ref-163">[162]</a></sup> </h4>
        <p class="text">The requirements to reinstate your license will depend on exactly why it was suspended or revoked. Call the DMV at 1-800-777-0133, ask them to look up your case, and find out what you need to do. When you call, be prepared with your old Driver License number and any information the DMV has sent to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-164" id="footnote-ref-164">[163]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Unless your Driver License was permanently revoked, you‚Äôll probably find out that you need to fulfill specific conditions (see <strong>STEP 2 </strong>below) and submit to the DMV ‚Äúproof of completion‚Äù of those conditions to reinstate your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-165" id="footnote-ref-165">[164]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If you have a Failure to Appear (FTA), Failure to Pay (FTP), or other failure to comply on your DMV record (which may be the reason your Driver License was suspended and/or make it difficult to renew your license), and the charge is <em>more than 5 years old</em>, you may be able to get the charge erased from your DMV record and reinstate your license by calling the DMV Mandatory Actions Line at 916-657-6525.<sup><a href="#footnote-166" id="footnote-ref-166">[165]</a></sup> </ol>
        <h4 class="step">Make sure that you fulfill the conditions of your suspension or revocation. </h4>
        <ol class="text">You may be required to complete traffic school, DUI treatment, or jail time, and to provide documents proving that you did so. You may also be required to pay fees and fines, including court-related fees and additional penalties imposed by the DMV. See the chart on PG.¬†52 for examples of requirements and steps to get your license back.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Keep all documents proving that you‚Äôve fulfilled these conditions, such as certificates and pay stubs, and be prepared to submit them as required. </ol>
        <ol class="text">You will also need to submit proof of ‚Äúfinancial responsibility.‚Äù Most of the time, this means proof of car insurance.<sup><a href="#footnote-167" id="footnote-ref-167">[166]</a></sup> </ol>
        <h4 class="step">Prepare all required documents and payments.</h4>
        <p class="text">Make copies of all your important documents, and keep careful records of all payments.</p>
        <h4 class="step">Submit all required documents and payments to the DMV. </h4>
        <p class="text">Confirm that you‚Äôre eligible to reinstate your license, and get proof from the DMV. </p>
        <p class="text">Once you‚Äôve completed these 4 steps, you may be able to reinstate your driver license (if it was <em>suspended</em>) or apply for a renewal driver license (if it was <em>revoked</em>). In some cases, if you‚Äôve completed some or most of the requirements, you may be able to get a <em>restricted license</em> if your suspension or revocation period hasn‚Äôt ended yet.<sup><a href="#footnote-168" id="footnote-ref-168">[167]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your license was suspended due to court-ordered debt, and these debts have been referred to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) for collection, there is a special payment process to speed up the return of your driver license. For instructions, go online to <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/payment.shtml">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/payment.shtml</a>, and see Appendix¬†G, PG.¬†102.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">* Helpful Hint <a id="Unpaid_child_support"></a>What are my options if my driver license was suspended because of unpaid child support?</h4>
        <p class="textbox">If your driver license was suspended due to unpaid child support and you cannot pay the amount required, you can ask a judge to reinstate your license temporarily. To do so, you can file a Notice of Motion for Judicial Review of License Denial (Form FL-670) with the court that issued your child support order.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-169" id="footnote-ref-169">[168]</a></sup></sup> This form asks the judge of that court to consider giving you back your driver license so that you can continue to go to work and earn money to pay the child support. The judge, not the local child support agency (LCSA), will make the final decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-170" id="footnote-ref-170">[169]</a></sup></sup> For more information about child support, see PG.¬†770 of the FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN CHAPTER.</p>
