        <h1>Post-release — Getting a Social Security Card After You’re Out:</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860900"></a>I am <a id="Replacement_SSC_After_Release"></a>formerly incarcerated, and I used to have a SSN. How do I get a replacement Social Security card? </h3>
        <p class="text">You can apply to your local SSA office in person or make the request by mail. We strongly recommend applying IN PERSON for 3 reasons:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">NEVER HAD A SSN? NEED AN ORIGINAL CARD?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">You can only get an original SSN and card after you’re released. Go to PG. 41 to learn how.</p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>REASON 1:</strong> First, if you go in person, the SSA agent can actually see that you are a real person. This helps verify your identify, especially if you are coming out of prison or jail without any other official ID documents.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>REASON 2:</strong> Second, it will be less of a hassle for you to go in person. If you request a replacement card by mail, you must submit your <em>original</em> ID documents with your application. <em>This means that while your application is being processed, you won’t have these ID documents for other purposes.</em> </ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>REASON 3:</strong> Lastly, the in-person process is much faster than the by-mail process. If the SSA accepts your application in person, you can leave with your new Social Security number the same day (and they will mail you the card)! In contrast, applications by mail can take days or weeks to process. </ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Not sure if you ever had a ssn?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you’re not sure if you’ve ever had a SSN, unfortunately there’s no easy way to check. There are services that you can pay to check, but it’s unclear if they are trustworthy. For this situation, we suggest trying to get a replacement card, and seeing if the SSA tells you that there was no original card to replace.</p>
        <ol class="text">In case you still decide to make your request by mail, we explain both application processes below: <em>application in person</em> (PG. 39) and <em>application by mail</em> (PG. 40). </ol>
