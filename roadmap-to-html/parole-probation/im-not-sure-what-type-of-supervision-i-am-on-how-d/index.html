        <h1>I‚Äôm not sure what type of supervision I am on. How do I find out?</h1>
        <p class="text">You may not know what type of supervision you are under. It‚Äôs possible that you could be under more than one type of supervision, or under different types back-to-back. If you don‚Äôt know, and <em>you are still incarcerated</em>, you should ask a correctional counselor in your institution. If you don‚Äôt know, and <em>you are out</em>, you should ask the case manager or supervising officer you report to.<em> </em></p>
        <p>Once you know what type of supervision applies to you, you can skip to the section in this chapter that is relevant to your situation.</p>
        <ol class="text">If you are (or will be) on state parole, go to PG.¬†142.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you are (or will be) on county probation, or some other county-level supervision (like ‚Äúmandatory supervision‚Äù or ‚ÄúPRCS‚Äù), go to PG.¬†196.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you are (or will be) on federal probation, go to PG.¬†213.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you are (or will be) on federal supervised release, go to PG.¬†223.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you are (or will be) on federal parole, go to PG.¬†235.</ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">A Note About the Terms Used in the Parole &amp; Probation Chapter:</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In this Chapter, when we refer to people returning from the community from prison and jail, we often use official terms and phrases that are used by the California Department of Corrections (CDCR) and other correctional agencies. We don‚Äôt always agree with this official language, and we believe it can be dehumanizing; but at times we use it in order to explain the official rules clearly to our readers. Meanwhile, we support efforts to use humanizing language when talking about currently or formerly incarcerated people. To learn more about such efforts, led by formerly incarcerated advocates, visit Root &amp; Rebound‚Äôs blog post summarizing an open letter by Eddie Ellis: <a href="https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/">https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/</a><strong>.</strong></p>
