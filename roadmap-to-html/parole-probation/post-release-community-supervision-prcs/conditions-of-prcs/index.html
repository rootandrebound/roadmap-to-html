            <p class="text">You must comply with all of your conditions on PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-761" id="footnote-ref-761">[760]</a></sup> The standard conditions include:</p>
            <ol class="text">A waiver of your Fourth Amendment Rights—agreeing to be searched by law enforcement without probable cause;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Informing the Probation Department of your home and work addresses; and</ol>

            <p class="text">Yes—you should refer to your signed CDCR Form 1515, “Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see Appendix G, PG. 262 for an example of this form).<sup><a href="#footnote-763" id="footnote-ref-763">[762]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">If you do not sign the conditions while you are still incarcerated, the prison/jail staff will notify the county of your supervision, and you can be held in custody until you sign Form 1515 or until your credits expire.<sup><a href="#footnote-764" id="footnote-ref-764">[763]</a></sup> </p>

            <p class="text">Yes. The legal standards for determining whether a PRCS condition is unlawful are generally the same as for parole conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-765" id="footnote-ref-765">[764]</a></sup> Please refer to, PG. 173 to understand what makes a PRCS or state parole condition lawful or unlawful.</p>
            <li id="footnote-765"><p> See Prison Law Office, The Parolee Rights Manual at 34, <a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf">http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf</a> <a href="#footnote-ref-765">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text">The procedure will depend on whether the supervising agency (the county probation department) or the court made the decision, and when the challenge is being raised.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS SET BY THE PROBATION OFFICER SUPERVISING YOUR PRCS:</strong> then you should complete any administrative appeal or grievance process that is available through Probation. If there is no administrative appeal process or the administrative appeal is unsuccessful, then you can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the local superior court.<sup><a href="#footnote-766" id="footnote-ref-766">[765]</a></sup> See Appendix K PG. 274 to learn how to file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS SET BY THE COURT JUDGE OR A COURT-APPOINTED HEARING OFFICER:</strong> then you should be able to proceed with a court challenge. It appears likely that a direct appeal can be filed under the statute that allows an appeal to be filed “from any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.” To appeal, you must file a notice of appeal in the superior court within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>When a timely notice of appeal is filed, </strong>the Superior Court will prepare a record of the parole revocation proceedings with all the documents filed in the court AND transcripts of the hearings, and will provide these documents to the Court of Appeal, the State, and to you (the parolee). </p>
            <ol class="text">In a direct appeal, an attorney will be appointed by the Court of Appeal at state’s expense, if the parolee does not have enough money to pay for one. </ol>
            <ol class="text">If you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file your notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. </ol>
            <p class="text">If the notice of appeal is not timely filed or if the issue involves information that is not in the court record, it might be possible to raise the issues in a state court habeas corpus petition. </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Whether or not issues from your case can be raised on a habeas appeal can be a difficult subject to determine. For this reason, it is recommended that you seek help from a court-appointed attorney, if possible. Again, remember that if you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file your notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision.</p>
            <p class="text">Please refer to Appendix K, on PG. 274 for more information on direct appeals and state habeas corpus petitions, including sample forms.</p>

            <p class="text">There are different types of consequences for not following (violating) the terms and conditions of your post-release community supervision (PRCS). These include:</p>
            <ol class="text"><strong>INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS:</strong> PRCS agencies are supposed to develop and use “intermediate sanctions” for minor violations of PRCS conditions. Intermediate sanctions could include programs like drug treatment, mental health counseling, and job assistance.<sup><a href="#footnote-767" id="footnote-ref-767">[766]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><strong>FLASH INCARCERATION:</strong> Another type of punishment for violating a PRCS condition is “flash incarceration.” Flash incarceration is an immediate return to jail for a period of up to 10 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-768" id="footnote-ref-768">[767]</a></sup> One of the conditions for being placed on PRCS is that you give up the right to demand a court hearing before being subject to flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-769" id="footnote-ref-769">[768]</a></sup> </ol>
            <ol class="text"><strong>COURT PETITION TO MODIFY/REVOKE/TERMINATE PRCS:</strong> If county probation decides that more serious punishment is appropriate for the violation, the agency will file a petition to modify, revoke, or terminate PRCS through the County Superior Court. Probation’s petition will be filed with a hearing officer appointed by the local Superior Court. Either the supervising agency (probation department) or the hearing officer can decide to keep a person in custody (in jail) while the petition is pending.<sup><a href="#footnote-770" id="footnote-ref-770">[769]</a></sup></ol>

            <p class="text">California state law governs the process for transferring a person’s PRCS between counties.<sup><a href="#footnote-771" id="footnote-ref-771">[770]</a></sup> Unlike with transfers of informal probation, PG. 190, formal probation, PG. 194, and Mandatory Supervision, PG. 202,<sup><a href="#footnote-772" id="footnote-ref-772">[771]</a></sup> the Court does NOT have the authority to transfer a person’s PRCS. Instead, the PRCS transfer process is administrative, and happens directly from one county to another.<sup><a href="#footnote-773" id="footnote-ref-773">[772]</a></sup> The internal policy of probation departments is to accept post-release transfers only, so once you are released, the process for transferring counties on PRCS is as follows:</p>
            <h4 class="step">Write a letter to your probation officer formally stating your intention to live in another county. The probation department must find that transfer is appropriate under the circumstances. In addition to considering factors such as the victim’s safety, the probation officer must determine that:</h4>
            <ol class="text">You have proof of permanent residence in another county (see box), AND</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your change of residence was either approved by probation OR didn’t violate the terms and conditions of your PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-774" id="footnote-ref-774">[773]</a></sup></ol>
            <h4 class="step">The supervising agency (the county probation department) then has two weeks to send any information it received from CDCR before you were released to the probation department in your new county of permanent residence.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-775" id="footnote-ref-775">[774]</a></sup></strong>Once the new county’s probation department has verified your permanent residency in its county, the agency must accept you on PRCS there.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-776" id="footnote-ref-776">[775]</a></sup></strong> </h4>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE: Your supervising agency (the county probation department) is not required to transfer your PRCS to another county unless you have shown your ability to establish <em>permanent residence</em> within another county without violating the terms and conditions of your PRCS. </p>
            <h5 class="question">How do I prove I have a permanent residence to transfer my PRCS to a new county?</h5>
            <p class="text">To verify that you live in the requested county, the county probation department will need proof of permanent residence. This may include:</p>
            <ol class="text">A face-to-face visit from a probation officer at your new home</ol>
            <ol class="text">A California driver’s license with your new address</ol>
            <ol class="text">Voter registration documents</ol>
            <ol class="text">A copy of a rental agreement</ol>
            <ol class="text">A form from a friend or family member verifying that you will live with them</ol>
            <ol class="text">Credit card or utility bills</ol>
            <ol class="text">Car registration or insurance documents</ol>
            <p class="text">Living somewhere only for employment or school, or living in a transitional housing or residential treatment facility, will not be considered a “permanent residence” for the purpose of transferring yourPRCS to another county.<sup><a href="#footnote-777" id="footnote-ref-777">[776]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="importantbox"> IMPORTANT: The same rules for transferring states apply to people on ANY type of state or county supervision. That means if you are on state parole, probation, PRCS, OR mandatory supervision—the process and rules to transfer your supervision to another state are the same.
