            <p class="text">If you are serving on an indeterminate sentence (for example, ‚Äú15 years to life‚Äù), you will go before the board 13 months before your minimum eligible parole date (MEPD) for a hearing to decide whether you should be released on parole.</p>
            <p class="text">There are also special early parole processes for certain populations, including youth offender parole (see the section on SB 260/SB 261 below), the elderly parole program, non-violent second strike parole consideration, and compassionate release. Some of these programs involve a full hearing and others are just a ‚Äúpaper process‚Äù with no hearing. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>[BOX: You can write us or call our Reentry Hotline (any Friday, 9AM ‚Äì 5PM, at phone number 510-279-4662) if you would like additional information on any of these special paroles processes!]</strong></p>

            <p class="text">If you are serving on a life sentence, you have the right to be represented by an attorney at your parole suitability hearing. If you qualify as ‚Äúindigent,‚Äù an attorney will be provided at the state‚Äôs expense. You can also hire an attorney to represent you. </p>
            <p class="text">See Appendix¬†LL for a list of attorneys and organizations that provide representation at parole board hearings at reasonable rates. </p>
