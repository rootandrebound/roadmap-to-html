        <h1>Challenging a Revocation decision</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861223"></a>What rights do I have if I am a person with a disability going through probation revocation proceedings? </h3>
        <p class="text">The ADA and California state law protect your rights during probation revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-849" id="footnote-ref-849">[848]</a></sup> In addition, you have a constitutional right to Due Process during a revocation hearing,<sup><a href="#footnote-850" id="footnote-ref-850">[849]</a></sup> this means that the court must give you notice of and ensure that you can participate effectively in the hearing. (See PG. 206 above for more information on your Due Process rights during a probation revocation hearing).</p>
        <p class="text">If you have a disability, you have the following rights during probation revocation proceedings:</p>
        <ol class="text">Reasonable accommodations from Probation staff<sup><a href="#footnote-851" id="footnote-ref-851">[850]</a></sup> Examples of accommodations include: Ensuring access to the hearing room for a person with mobility impairments; providing Braille or taped documents or reading assistance for a vision-impaired person; providing assistance in communicating for a developmentally disabled person; or providing sign language interpretation for a hearing-impaired person. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Probation staff must use effective communication and provide accommodations when interacting with people on probation with disabilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-852" id="footnote-ref-852">[851]</a></sup> That means that they must use effective communication and provide accommodation when arresting parolees or modifying conditions of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-853" id="footnote-ref-853">[852]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">In the courtroom, attorney and court are responsible for meeting your needs during the court processes.<sup><a href="#footnote-854" id="footnote-ref-854">[853]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Additional assistance to accommodate your disability so that ensure that you can fully and successfully participate in the revocation proceeding.<sup><a href="#footnote-855" id="footnote-ref-855">[854]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Information about your right to receive accommodations and equal treatment, and how this affects your probation programming and requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-856" id="footnote-ref-856">[855]</a></sup></ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">IMPORTANT TIPS IN COURT:</h4>
        <ul class="textbox"><strong>Tell the judge about your disability and how it affects your probation</strong>: Remember, the judge has much more power than your probation officer in deciding whether or not to revoke your probation. So if your disability is making it difficult for you to comply with your probation conditions (and if this is the reason for your revocation), you should try to explain this to the judge. Remember to bring documentation (i.e. letters from doctors, medical reports) of your disability to court with you. <strong>Tell the Judge what assistance you need from the Probation Department to accommodate your disability</strong>: You should also explain if you need any additional assistance from the Probation Department.<sup><a href="#footnote-857" id="footnote-ref-857">[856]</a></sup> <strong>Bring Witnesses:</strong> Finally, you can also bring any witnesses (for example, a doctor, therapist, or other service provider) and evidence (such as a letter from your doctor or prescription for medication) to show how your disability affects you.</ul>

            <p class="text">Yes. If you are on probation and would like to challenge a court’s revocation decision or related action, you can file a <strong>direct appeal</strong> on “any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.”<sup><a href="#footnote-858" id="footnote-ref-858">[857]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> To file an appeal, you must file a notice of appeal in the superior court within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-859" id="footnote-ref-859">[858]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 2:</strong> When you file a timely notice of appeal, the County Superior will prepare a record of the probation revocation proceedings consisting of all the documents filed in the court and transcripts of the hearings and provide these documents to you, the court, the state (the prosecutor). In a direct appeal, the court must appoint an attorney to represent the you for free if you do not have enough money to pay for one. If you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file a timely notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. For a list of County Superior Courts, visit: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm</a>.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 3:</strong> If you do not file a timely notice of appeal or if your case involves information outside the court record, then you may be able to raise the issues in a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus (see explanation in Appendix K, on PG. 274).</p>
            <p class="text">There are many issues that you can raise in a challenge to a revocation proceeding or decision. Claims can be based on violations of state or federal constitutional due process rights, California or federal statutes, or California administrative rules. For example, a person could argue that the revocation hearing is being unreasonably delayed, that he or she was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses at the hearing, or that the revocation decision was not supported by the evidence. Unfortunately, in most cases, the process for raising such challenges will be too slow to provide any relief before you serve the entire revocation term. However, you may still benefit by getting your revocation case re-heard, getting revocations vacated, and/or getting the parole department to subtract the time served for the revocation from your parole “controlling discharge date” (CDD).</p>

            <p class="text"><em>First, some background:</em> The rules for transferring from one state to another when on state- or county-level supervision (such as parole, PRCS, mandatory supervision, or county probation) are are set by a legal agreement called <em>the </em><a id="PP_InterstateCompactICOAS"></a><strong><em>Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision</em></strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-860" id="footnote-ref-860">[859]</a></sup></sup> The Compact applies in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-861" id="footnote-ref-861">[860]</a></sup></sup> If you are classfied as a sex offender requesting transfer to a different state, special additional rules apply to you (see PG. 212).</p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>If you are currently incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">At the earliest, California can send an interstate transfer request for you 120 days before your expected release date (ERD).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-862" id="footnote-ref-862">[861]</a></sup></sup> The receiving state should respond within 45 days of receiving the transfer request.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-863" id="footnote-ref-863">[862]</a></sup></sup> The process can be sped up in an emergency.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-864" id="footnote-ref-864">[863]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>If you are formerly incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">If you are living in the community, you may request to transfer your parole to a new state if you meet basic eligibility requirements (listed below under Step 1).</p>
            <h4 class="step">Confirm that you meet the basic eligibility requirements to request an interstate parole transfer. The basic requirements are:</h4>
            <ol class="text">As of the time your application is submitted to your requested state, you have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on parole; </ol>
            <ol class="text">You have a valid supervision plan; </ol>
            <ol class="text">You have not had parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; AND</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>EITHER</em> of the following is true:</ol>
            <ol class="text">You are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em> You have family that lives in the state and is willing and able to assist you (regardless of whether you decide to live with them), and you can obtain employment or have another means of supporting yourself;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-865" id="footnote-ref-865">[864]</a></sup></sup> AND</ol>
            <ol class="text">You have paid off your restitution orders in California, unless a judge finds that releasing you to transfer parole to another state would be “in the interests of justice.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-866" id="footnote-ref-866">[865]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE: Even if you do not meet these requirements, California and the receiving state (the state you wish to transfer to) may agree to grant your request if they find “good cause” (a very good reason) to do so.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-867" id="footnote-ref-867">[866]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <h4 class="step">If you meet the eligibility requirements, communicate your transfer request to your parole agent. It’s best to make this request in writing so that you have a paper trail, and keep a copy of it in a safe place. Your parole agent should confirm that you meet the eligibility requirements. He or she must then submit a transfer request to the CDCR’s Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA.If the CDCR approves, it should send the transfer request to the receiving state. The receiving state should then decide whether to approve your transfer request.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-868" id="footnote-ref-868">[867]</a></sup></sup>If the receiving state approves your request, you should then be transferred.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-869" id="footnote-ref-869">[868]</a></sup></sup></h4>
            <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Special rules apply in a couple of situations: (1) if you must register as a sex offender (see next question), or (2) you are on state parole and still owe victim’s restitution. If you owe victim’s restitution, you are barred under <em>California state law</em> from transferring your parole to a different state<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-870" id="footnote-ref-870">[869]</a></sup></sup></p>

            <p class="textbox">We mentioned earlier that each state in the U.S. runs its own criminal justice system—including deciding criminal laws, methods of incarceration, and community supervision. In addition to each state running its own system, the federal government (which oversees all the states) has a separate system to prosecute federal offenses (including things like drug trafficking, human trafficking, immigration, national security, computer fraud, corporate “white-collar” crimes.) In the next two sections of the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn about the types of correctional supervision in the community that are RUN BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:</p>
