            <li id="footnote-825"><p> In Morrissey v. Brewer, the U.S. Supreme Court established minimal due process requirements for parole revocation proceedings under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 408 U.S. 471, 488-89 (1972). With regard to the revocation of probation, the Court subsequently held that “a probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrissey.” Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973). Thus, the State “must provide the same process [found in Morrissey ] when terminating a probationer from probation.” State v. Rogers, 144 Idaho 738, 742–43 (2007); State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012). While Morrissey and Gagnon holdings make clear that probationers do not retain the full constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants, a probationer has a protected liberty interest in continued probation, and is therefore entitled to due process before probation may be revoked. Morrissey and Gagnon set forth those minimum due process requirements. See State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012). Cases since Morrissey have reaffirmed those rights and described them more specifically. See People v. Vickers, 8 Cal. 3d 451 (1979) (“[T]he efficient administration of justice requires that the defendant be assisted by retained or appointed counsel at all revocation proceedings other than at summary proceedings had while the probationer remains at liberty after absconding.”); see also, Gagnon V.

If the hearing officer determines that there is “good cause” that a witness does not have to testify, then the hearing officer may take into consideration that witness’s past out-of-court statements, even though the witness will not be in court you to confront. For example, if a judge determines that there is “good cause” that a witness’s safety will be in danger if he or she testifies at your probation revocation hearing, then the witness’s past statements are admissible at your hearing. But remember—the more important the witness’s testimony is to the case, the stronger your right to confront and question that witness is (see U.S. v. Comito, 177 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir. 1999); Valdivia v Schwarzenegger, 599 F.3d 984, 989 (9th Cir. 2010); People v. Arreola, 7 Cal.4th 1144, 1154 (1994). See also Gagnon V.

            <p class="text">If a very important (called “material”) state witness fails to attend a parole revocation hearing, and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case.<sup><a href="#footnote-844" id="footnote-ref-844">[843]</a></sup> </p>
            <li id="footnote-844"><p> To decide whether the witness’s testimony would be “material,” the court will weight the importance of the witness’s expected testimony against the availability and reliability of any alternative source of the same information. Also, if the state’s material witnesses fail to appear, but your witnesses are present, you and your attorney may want to ask that the court to take the testimony of your witnesses before postponing the rest of the hearing.See Cal. Penal Code § 1050(e).  <a href="#footnote-ref-844">↑</a></p></li>
