        <h1>General conditions of federal parole</h1>
        <ol class="text">Go directly to your <em>approved residence</em> in the district named in your Certificate of Release (unless you are released to a detainer, explained on PG.¬†237 above);</ol>
        <ol class="text">Report in-person within 3 days (72 hours) to the U.S. Probation Office named on your Certificate of Release. If because of an emergency you are unable to appear in person within 3 days (72 hours) after your release, you should report to the nearest U.S. Probation Office and obey any instructions that the ‚Äúduty officer‚Äù gives you. </ol>
        <ol class="text">If you were released to another authority (not U.S. Probation), then you should follow these first 2 steps as soon as you are released from the custody of the other authority.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Cooperate with your Probation Officer, and provide any information requested to your Probation Officer. You must answer completely and truthfully when the Probation Officer asks you for information.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Between the first and third day of each month, you must make a written report to the supervision officer on a form provided to you.<sup> </sup>The written report will look different depending where you are. It will most likely look like a worksheet where you will fill out your address, job information, and answer other questions about your life, or a form that you will fill out and submit on line at the probation office‚Äôs website. Your Probation Officer will show you how to fill this out and give it to you at your check-in. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Report to your Probation Officer as that officer directs. </ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Talking to our P.O. about an Arrest</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Under the federal law that governs federal parole, if you end up being arrested for an incident that police questioned you about (or any other incident), you must tell your probation officer. It could help to show the USPC that you are being honest with your P.O. and trying hard to comply.</p>
        <ol class="text">Tell your Probation Officer if you are arrested or questioned by law enforcement/police within 2 days of the contact with law enforcement. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Tell your Probation Officer if you change your job or address within 2 days of the change.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must let the Probation Officer to visit your home and workplace.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must let the Probation Officer take any item that the officer reasonably believes you are not allowed to have (for example, an illegal drug or a weapon), and that is in plain view in your possession (meaning they can see it without having to open drawers or dig through compartments), including in your home, workplace, or vehicle.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must take a drug or alcohol test whenever your Probation Officer orders you to take the test.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1034" id="footnote-ref-1034">[1033]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong>Additional Conditions that Prohibit Certain Conduct:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">You cannot violate any law and must not associate with any person who is violating any law.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot possess a firearm, any other dangerous weapon, or ammunition.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot <em>illegally</em> <em>possess or use</em> a controlled substance.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot drink alcoholic beverages to excess. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Stay away from a place where a controlled substance is illegally sold, used, or given away.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot leave your district of supervision without permission. (See PG.¬†242 for instructions on how to get permission to leave your district of permission.)</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot associate with a person who has a criminal record without the permission of your Probation Officer. </ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot act as an informant (meaning someone who gives information to law enforcement/police about secret or criminal activities) for any law enforcement officer without the prior approval of the U.S. Parole Commission.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1035" id="footnote-ref-1035">[1034]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <p class="text"><strong>Additional Conditions You Must Follow:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">You must make a good faith effort to work regularly, unless excused by your Probation Officer.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must support your children and any legal dependents.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must participate in an employment-readiness program if your supervision officer tells you to do so.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must make a good faith effort to pay any fine, restitution order, court costs or assessment or court-ordered child support or alimony payment. If asked by your Probation Officer, you must provide your financial information. You must cooperate with your Probation Officer in setting up an installment plan to pay these debts and obligations.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If your underlying conviction was for a domestic violence crime, and it was your first conviction for domestic violence, you must attend an approved offender-rehabilitation program for the prevention of domestic violence (if such a program is readily available within 50 miles of your home).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If required by law, you must register with any applicable special offender registration law, for example, a law that requires you to register as a ‚Äúsex offender‚Äù or a ‚Äúgun offender.‚Äù</ol>
        <ol class="text">If directed by your Probation Officer AND if authorized by the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, you must provide a DNA sample.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must inform a person about your criminal record or personal history if your supervision officer determines that your relationship or contact with this person may pose a risk of harm to this person. The Probation Officer may direct you to do this and then ask for some form of confirmation or proof that you followed the direction. The Probation Officer may also speak directly with that person.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1036" id="footnote-ref-1036">[1035]</a></sup></sup></ol>

            <p><strong>Yes, if you get permission from your Probation Officer and/or the Parole Commission first.</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1037" id="footnote-ref-1037">[1036]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <ol class="text">Your Probation Officer may give you permission to travel outside your federal parole district without approval of the U.S. Parole Commission in the following situations:</ol>
            <ol class="text">Vacation trips for 30 days or less.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Trips to look into certain employment possibilities for 30 days or less.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Repeated travel across a district boundary, no more than 50 miles outside the district, for a job, shopping, or recreation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1038" id="footnote-ref-1038">[1037]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">For the following types of travel, you must (1) get the Parole Commission‚Äôs advance permission <em>in writing</em>, <em>and</em> (2) show a substantial need for such travel:</ol>
            <ol class="text">All foreign travel;</ol>
            <ol class="text">A job that requires you to repeatedly travel more than 50 miles outside your federal parole district (except offshore job locations); and</ol>
            <ol class="text">Vacation travel outside the district for more than 30 days.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1039" id="footnote-ref-1039">[1038]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">A special condition imposed by the Regional Commissioner prohibiting certain travel shall supersede any of the above general rules.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1040" id="footnote-ref-1040">[1039]</a></sup></sup> This means that if you have a special condition that prohibits certain travel then you will not be able to travel even if you meet the conditions above. </ol>
