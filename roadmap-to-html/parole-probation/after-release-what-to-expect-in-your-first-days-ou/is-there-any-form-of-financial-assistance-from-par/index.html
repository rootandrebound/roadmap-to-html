        <h1>Is there any form of financial assistance from parole when I first get out?</h1>
        <p class="text">Yes, but it is <em>very limited </em>and for a very small amount. You are entitled to the money in your trust account and gate money. You may be able to get other emergency funds by requesting them through your parole agent. Below we explain the types of financial assistance you can ask for on your first days out in more detail:</p>
        <h5 class="numberboldblack">TRUST ACCOUNTS: </h5>
        <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “INTEREST”?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Interest is a small percentage amount of your money being held that gets added to your account periodically for the prison having the ability to hold your money.</p>
        <p class="text">Money that you brought to, earned, or received in prison is kept in an interest-bearing trust account. The “interest” is paid to the trust account on a monthly basis, minus operational expenses incurred. Any money in your prison trust account, including any interest you earned, must be given to you at your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-346" id="footnote-ref-346">[346]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">I WAS IN CDCR’s CUSTODY FOR LESS THAN 6 MONTHS DUE TO A PAROLE VIOLATION. DO I GET GATE MONEY WHEN I AM RELEASED?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you were returned to the custody of prison or jail on a parole violation—but were there for less than 6 months—you will receive $1.10 per day that you are held, up to a maximum of $200. (<em>See</em> 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3075.2(d)(4).)</p>
        <h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="PP_StateParole_GateMoney"></a>GATE MONEY (a.k.a. “RELEASE ALLOWANCE”):</h5>
        <h4>&gt; $200 GATE MONEY:</h4>
        <p class="text">If you are leaving state prison and you are (1) paroled, (2) placed on post-release community supervision (PRCS), or (3) discharged from a CDCR institution or reentry facility, you are entitled to $200 in state funds upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-347" id="footnote-ref-347">[347]</a></sup> Even though your parole agent is responsible for giving you these funds, the agent is not required to give you the entire amount immediately. Instead, your parole agent may distribute the $200 in separate, smaller amounts over a period of 60 days following your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-348" id="footnote-ref-348">[348]</a></sup> By the end of those 60 days, you should have received the entire $200. If you need to purchase clothes or a bus ticket at the time of your release, you must pay for it; CDCR does not provide extra gate money for clothing or transportation, but will deduct it from your $200 gate money if you ask them to front this cost.<sup><a href="#footnote-349" id="footnote-ref-349">[349]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You also have the right to the $200 gate money in the following cases:</p>
        <ul class="importantbox">If you were sent to a local jail for civil commitment proceedings or evaluation as a “sexually violent predator” (SVP).<sup><a href="#footnote-350" id="footnote-ref-350">[350]</a></sup>If you are a “lifer parolee” who returned to prison on a parole violation, when you are re-released to parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-351" id="footnote-ref-351">[351]</a></sup>If you served 6 straight months or more on a sentence OR on a return-to-custody for a parole violation (these 6 months could be time spent in jail or in prison).<sup><a href="#footnote-352" id="footnote-ref-352">[352]</a></sup><em>If you do not receive your gate money in one of these situations—a common occurrence—you should file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal. Ask your jail or parole officer for the proper forms.</em></ul>
        <h4>&gt; YOU WILL GET ONLY $100 GATE MONEY IF YOU ALREADY RECEIVED A $100 ADVANCE</h4>
        <p class="text">If you are released from prison into a Community Correctional Reentry Facility<sup><a href="#footnote-353" id="footnote-ref-353">[353]</a></sup> or Alternative Custody Program (ACP),<sup><a href="#footnote-354" id="footnote-ref-354">[354]</a></sup> you may be given an advance of up to $100 of your gate money at that time.<sup><a href="#footnote-355" id="footnote-ref-355">[355]</a></sup> Once you are released from the reentry facility or ACP, you may only receive what is left of the $200 not yet given to you—for most, this will be $100 remaining.<sup><a href="#footnote-356" id="footnote-ref-356">[356]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4>&gt; YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE YOUR GATE MONEY IF YOU ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON INTO THE CUSTODY OF ANOTHER AGENCY THAT IS DETAINING YOU</h4>
        <p class="text">If you are released from prison into the custody of another state, local law enforcement, or the federal government (meaning, you are released from state prison and into the custody of a federal prison or another jail/prison because you have been convicted or face charges in another jurisdiction), you will not get any gate money until you are released from that custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-357" id="footnote-ref-357">[357]</a></sup> Similarly, if you are released from prison into the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and are waiting a deportation hearing date, you will not get gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-358" id="footnote-ref-358">[358]</a></sup></p>
        <h4>&gt; YOU WILL FORFEIT (GIVE UP) YOUR RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION</h4>
        <p class="text">If you abscond from parole (meaning you flee, go missing, or do not report to your parole agent as required) before receiving all of your gate money, you give up your right to the gate money. This means if you fail to report or to let your parole agent know of your whereabouts, you lose your right to the $200 gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-359" id="footnote-ref-359">[359]</a></sup> If you abscond from parole, you also risk: 1) getting your parole revoked and going back to prison; 2) being held on parole for a longer time period than originally required; 3) being forced to wear a GPS tracking advice by parole (see PG. 168). </p>
        <h4>&gt; YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION</h4>
        <p class="text">If you are released after being placed in jail for parole revocation proceedings, you do not receive gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-360" id="footnote-ref-360">[360]</a></sup></p>
        <h5 class="question">What should I do if I don’t get my gate money?</h5>
        <p class="text">Your parole officer should provide you your gate money at your release. If, however, your officer does not have the money or does not know where to send it, you should file an administrative appeal (CDCR Form 602 and CDCR Form 22) and start the grievance process. We recommend keeping copies and dates of any appeals or grievance forms you submit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-361" id="footnote-ref-361">[361]</a></sup></sup> If you are in special proceedings—like MDO (Mentally Disordered Offender) or SVP (Sexually Violent Predator) hearings—your public defender/defense attorney <em>may</em> be able to help you with this process, as getting the gate money is more complicated. To learn how to file an administrative appeal on a CDCR Form 602, see PG. 175.</p>
        <h5 class="numberboldblack">EMERGENCY FUNDS </h5>
        <p class="text">There are 2 very limited types of emergency funds<sup><a href="#footnote-362" id="footnote-ref-362">[362]</a></sup> that you can request through your parole agent: (1) Cash Assistance Loans (also called “financial assistance funds”)<sup><a href="#footnote-363" id="footnote-ref-363">[363]</a></sup> and (2) Funds for Services (also called “Bank Drafts”).<sup><a href="#footnote-364" id="footnote-ref-364">[364]</a></sup> Unfortunately, in these current tight budget times, these funds are extremely limited.</p>
        <p class="text">These funds are <em>discretionary</em>. This means that your parole agent and his or her supervisor decide whether to give you a “cash assistance loan” or funds for services. Their decision will depend on the following factors:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT STOPS THE CLOCK FOR MY LENGTH OF TIME ON PAROLE?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The clock for your parole period is paused if:(1) YOU GO MISSING: Any time during that you “abscond” from parole (go missing or fail to report to your parole agent), and any time you are not available for parole supervision, this “stops the clock” and does not count toward the parole period. (2) YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR (SVP) PROCEEDINGS: The parole term is “tolled” (paused) until the SVP proceedings are dismissed or you are discharged from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH).(3) YOU ARE SENT TO COUNTY JAIL (NOT PRISON) FOR A NEW FELONY CONVICTION. If you are sentenced to a county jail term for a new felony conviction, you will stay on parole while serving your jail sentence, but the clock will pause on your parole term. If the jail sentence ends before your controlling discharge date (CDD) (see chart on PG. 154), you must report to your parole officer upon release and finish serving your original parole term. But if your are sentenced for a new felony conviction, your parole will just be forgotten about—it isn’t paused, but it no longer matters. </p>
        <ol class="text">Whether there is money available;<sup><a href="#footnote-365" id="footnote-ref-365">[365]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">The circumstances, including your history and needs;<sup><a href="#footnote-366" id="footnote-ref-366">[366]</a></sup> AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether you are a citizen (as there are legal limits on the financial assistance that CA State Parole can provide to certain parolees who are <em>not</em> U.S. citizens).<sup><a href="#footnote-367" id="footnote-ref-367">[367]</a></sup></ol>
        <p><strong>(1) FIRST TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Cash Assistance Loans </strong></p>
        <p>Cash Assistance Loans (a.k.a. “Financial Assistance Funds”) are loans that you may request from your parole agent. CDCR expects you to pay back these loans as soon as possible (for example, once employment or other financial circumstances allow you to do so). These loans are only granted when there is a critical need and assistance is not available from any other source.<sup><a href="#footnote-368" id="footnote-ref-368">[368]</a></sup> The loans are usually for amounts under $50. The parole agent’s supervisor must approve any loan over $50 or any series of loans totaling more than $150 in a 30-day period.<sup><a href="#footnote-369" id="footnote-ref-369">[369]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>(2) SECOND TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Funds for Services:</strong></p>
        <p>Your parole agent is also authorized to distribute Funds for Services (a.k.a. “Bank Drafts”), including for housing, food, and clothing. Your parole agent may authorize a loan of up to $500 to you for over-the-counter purchases. The check may be written either directly to you or to the vendor who is selling the item that you are purchasing. Once again, the loans are granted on an emergency basis, and you must pay the money back as soon as you able to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-370" id="footnote-ref-370">[370]</a></sup></p>
