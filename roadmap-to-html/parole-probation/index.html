        <h1>Parole & Probation</h1>
        <p><strong><img src="40.png"/></strong></p>
        <p class="description">Being under some type of correctional community supervision is usually required to be released from prison or jail, and can sometimes be offered by a criminal court judge in place of incarceration. In the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn that there are <em>many</em> types of supervision in California ‚Äî state parole, county probation, mandatory supervision, PRCS, federal probation, federal supervised release, and federal parole. This chapter will help you understand what it means to be on community supervision, what rules you have to follow, and all the rights you have as a person in reentry.</p>
