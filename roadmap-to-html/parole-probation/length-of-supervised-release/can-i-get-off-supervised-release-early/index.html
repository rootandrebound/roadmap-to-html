        <h1>Can I get off supervised release early?</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>Possibly.</em> You can ask for an early termination of supervised release from the judge who originally sentenced you. You are eligible to be released early after one year of supervised release.<sup><a href="#footnote-926" id="footnote-ref-926">[925]</a></sup> Talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about this request first, because he or she can help you ask the judge for this.</p>
        <p class="text">The court has the power to decide whether or not to let you off supervised release early. In most cases, judges will deny requests to be let off supervised release early. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try, especially if you’ve done really well on your supervised release. And remember, it is really helpful if your Probation Officer supports your request. </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint</h4>
        <p class="textbox">You have the best shot of being let of supervised release early if:</p>
        <ul class="textbox">You have completed 2/3 of your supervised release term (or at the very least ½ way through),You have had no violations, You have complied with all the terms of your supervised release, You have paid all restitution and fines, and Your probation officer agrees that you should be let off early<sup><a href="#footnote-927" id="footnote-ref-927">[926]</a></sup></ul>
