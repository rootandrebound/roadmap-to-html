        <h1>What factors could hurt my request to move/transfer from being approved?</h1>
        <p class="text">Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing requests to transfer into their District. The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p>
        <ol class="text">No job offer in new area;</ol>
        <ol class="text">No or weak family and community ties in the new area;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);</ol>
        <ol class="text">You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;</ol>
        <ol class="text">You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The new address where you want to move is unsafe;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; and</ol>
        <ol class="text">The residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</ol>
