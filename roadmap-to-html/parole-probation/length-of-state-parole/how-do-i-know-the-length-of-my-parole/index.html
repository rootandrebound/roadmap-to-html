        <h1>How do I know the length of my parole?</h1>
        <p class="text">Your parole date will be listed on your CDCR Form 1515,<em> </em>“Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see example <strong>i</strong>n<strong> </strong>Appendix G<strong>, </strong>PG. 262). The Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO) is responsible for calculating these dates based on state law, and your parole agent must tell you what they are.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861009"></a>If I am on state parole, what law sets the length of my parole? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you are on state parole, the length of your parole period is set by state law<sup><a href="#footnote-369" id="footnote-ref-369">[368]</a></sup> and is based on your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you are or were incarcerated for), and <em>the date when the commitment offense occurred</em> (NOT the date you were sentenced or released).<sup><a href="#footnote-370" id="footnote-ref-370">[369]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-371" id="footnote-ref-371">[370]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum and maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See PG. 149 for more information. </p>
        <p class="text">There are three discharge dates to know — your <em>controlling</em>, <em>maximum,</em> and <em>presumptive</em> discharge date — that all affect when you can get off parole. And there are a number of factors that interact with those three dates to determine whether you can get off parole earlier or later than expected. See the chart on PG. 149 below for details about these three discharge dates.</p>
        <p class="text">You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms). For your reference, we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, PG. 259. (The California Penal Code is a body of laws that apply to crimes, parole, and other criminal justice system-related laws in California). To look up the discharge dates that apply to you, see Appendix C, PG. 255 of this chapter.</p>
        <table><tr><td colspan="3"><p class="tableheadingmedium">THE 3 DISCHARGE DATES TO KNOW TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU GET OFF STATE PAROLE</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CONTROLLING DISCH<a id="cdddischargechart"></a>ARGE DATE (CDD)</p></td><td><p>MAXIMUM DISCHARGE DATE (MDD)</p></td><td><p>PRESUMPTIVE DISCHARGE DATE (PDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>THE CDD IS YOUR BASE PAROLE PERIOD.</p><p>For example, if someone is on parole for 5 years with a maximum of 7 years, then the Controlling Discharge Date (CDD) is 5 years from the day of release from state prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-372" id="footnote-ref-372">[371]</a></sup></sup> </p></td><td><p>THE MDD IS THE MAXIMUM TIME YOU CAN BE HELD ON PAROLE. </p><p>For example, if someone is on parole for 5 years with a maximum of 7 years, then the Maximum Discharge Date (MDD) is 7 years from the day of release from state prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-373" id="footnote-ref-373">[372]</a></sup></sup> </p></td><td><p>THIS IS THE DATE YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET OFF PAROLE EARLY.</p><p>The PDD is the date you can be discharged from parole, and the date that you should be discharged if the BPH does not find “good cause” (a good reason) to retain you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-374" id="footnote-ref-374">[373]</a></sup></sup> This date is always before your CDD (base term). You can only get off on your PDD if you have served parole continuously without disruptions, meaning no violation time, suspensions, or “dead time” for absconding (going missing or failing to report to your parole agent).</p><p>For example, someone might have a 5-year parole length with a Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD) of 3 years. This means that the person is eligible to be discharged after 3 continuous years on parole.</p><div class="textbox8">IMPORTANT! Some people do not have a PDD—meaning certain individuals do not have a date on which they are eligible to get off parole early.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-375" id="footnote-ref-375">[374]</a></sup></sup></div></td></tr></table>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In addition to these three very important dates, you can ask your parole agent to recommend that you get off parole even earlier than your presumptive discharge date (PDD) — but this is very hard to achieve. For you to get off parole earlier than your PDD, every level of authority has to agree: the parole agent and his or her supervisor, the Regional Administrator for your parole region, and, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) must each approve your early release from parole.To determine your CDD, MDD, and PDD, see Appendix B, PG. 253. For a sample worksheet to calculate your own parole discharge date, see Appendix C, PG. 255.</p>

There is no limit on how long the CDD can be extended due to absconding or unavailability. Cal. Penal Code § 3000(b)(6)(B). Time served in custody for parole revocation terms will extend the CDD, but only until the MDD is reached. The CDD comes from state law: Cal.
