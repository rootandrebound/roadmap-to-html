        <p class="sidebox">It is important to know and understand these conditions because if you violate any of them, you may be arrested, incarcerated in a county jail, or returned to state prison, even if you are not convicted of a new crime. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†3000.08(c).)<strong> </strong></p>
