        <p class="text">To be considered a crime, your failure to register must be ‚Äúwillful.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-512" id="footnote-ref-512">[511]</a></sup> If you can show that you did not know you had to register or that you were unable to register <strong><em>due to circumstances beyond your control</em></strong>, then you may be able to avoid a conviction for violating the registration law.<sup><a href="#footnote-513" id="footnote-ref-513">[512]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">HOWEVER<strong>, </strong>it is <em>very difficult</em> to show that you did not know you had to register unless you were <strong><em>never notified</em></strong> of your duty to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-514" id="footnote-ref-514">[513]</a></sup> Simply forgetting to register is not a defense to this crime, even if your memory lapse was related to depression.<sup><a href="#footnote-515" id="footnote-ref-515">[514]</a></sup> But if you had a severe, involuntary (uncontrollable) physical or mental condition that caused you not to have actual knowledge of the duty to register, then you should be able to avoid a conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-516" id="footnote-ref-516">[515]</a></sup></p>
