        <h1>I am a 290 registrant, and I am on state parole. What other special conditions of parole could apply to me?</h1>
        <p class="text">Parole officials may impose other special conditions on parolees who were convicted of sex offenses. Some of these are <strong>required by state law</strong> and others can be imposed<strong> at the discretion of parole officials</strong>. </p>
        <p class="text"><em>Mandatory</em> special conditions of parole‚Äîmeaning they are <em>required</em> by state law‚Äîinclude the following: </p>
        <ol class="text">Attendance at group therapy for at least one year;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Waiver (giving up) of the privilege against self-incrimination;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Waiver the right not to participate in polygraph examination;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Waiver of psychotherapist-patient privilege during conversations with state-funded therapists. This means that any information you share in a therapy session could be used against you in the future if you ever face new criminal charges or Sexually Violent Predatory (SVP) proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-556" id="footnote-ref-556">[555]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text"><em>Discretionary </em>special conditions of parole‚Äîmeaning the parole officer gets to decide based on individual factors whether or not to impose these‚Äîinclude the following possibilities:</p>
        <ol class="text">Limitations or prohibitions on accessing computers, the Internet, or certain publications.<sup><a href="#footnote-557" id="footnote-ref-557">[556]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Prohibitions on living with minors, including your own children, step-children, nieces, nephews, or siblings.<sup><a href="#footnote-558" id="footnote-ref-558">[557]</a></sup></ol>
        <li id="footnote-556"><p> People v. Gonzales (2013) 56 Cal.4th 353 (holding that, in an SVP proceeding that took place prior to enactment of waiver requirement, admission of parolee‚Äôs statements to therapist did not violate his constitutional right to privacy; although admission of the statements violated California privilege statutes, the error was deemed harmless.) <a href="#footnote-ref-556">‚Üë</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-557"><p> Courts have found some of these conditions to be invalid. See e.g., In re Stevens 119 Cal.App.4th 1228 (2004) (unreasonable to prohibit use of computers Internet when neither used in committing crime); United States v. Gnirke 775 F.3d 1155 (2015) (special condition of supervision barring possession of any materials that depicted ‚Äúsexually explicit conduct‚Äù involving either children or adults, and forbidding registrant from patronizing any place where such materials or entertainment were available was overbroad).  <a href="#footnote-ref-557">‚Üë</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-558"><p> Whether such conditions are lawful depends on case-by-case factors, such as the scope of the condition, your type and number of sex offenses, the findings of any risk assessment evaluation, the sex and age of the minor child, and the closeness of the family relationship. See e.g., United States v. Wolf Child (9th Cir 2012) 699 F.3d 1082 (unreasonable and overbroad to prohibit registrant from living with or being in company of any minor under 18 or socializing with anyone with minor children, resulting in registrant being unable to live with or see his own (non-victim) daughters or socialize with his fianc√©e). <a href="#footnote-ref-558">‚Üë</a></p></li>
