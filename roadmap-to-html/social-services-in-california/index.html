        <h1>Social Services In California</h1>
        <p class="text"><strong>DEAR READERS:</strong></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Root &amp; Rebound is a <em>reentry legal advocacy nonprofit.</em></strong><em> </em>Our approach is based on the idea that <strong>attorneys and advocates</strong> can transfer powerful legal knowledge and skills to those who are in reentry and otherwise impacted by the criminal justice system, as well as the families, agencies, and communities that support them. With such a severe "justice gap" in our country and only one legal aid attorney for every 8,000 indigent people in California, we aim to <strong>create and share reentry legal information and resources</strong> that empower people to know their rights and options in reentry, with an educational approach instead of the traditional 1-to-1 client-attorney relationship.</p>
        <p class="text">As part of our approach, we produce reentry resources like the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, and other accompanying toolkits; we train community members, currently and formerly incarcerated people, and professionals working with the reentry population on this information; we run our weekly <strong>Reentry Legal Hotline</strong> (every Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., at 510-279-4662—we accept Collect Calls); and we respond to prison mail from currently incarcerated people looking for information about their rights, options, and supportive services in reentry.</p>
        <p class="text">We realize that information about legal issues related to reentry are often accompanied by the need to meet other basic needs post-release as well, <strong>things like food, housing, employment, health care and treatment</strong>, and other forms of social services support. While Root &amp; Rebound is NOT a social service agency—meaning we do <em>not</em> directly provide housing or jobs—we recognize the importance of making those connections with social services providers in the community and <strong>do our absolute best to know which agencies across the state of California are providing supportive social services to people in reentry.</strong></p>
        <p class="text">We are constantly discovering new community resources in California, and they are always expanding, diversifying, closing or otherwise changing. Because of this, it was not practical to list every social service agency in our <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide. Instead, we have created a series of <strong>county-based template information letters</strong> at our office. The information letters are collections of referral lists and flyers, guides produced by other organizations, and directories from county governments, as well as contact information for the organizations we have worked with or trained in the past. We add to these templates when we find new resources and try to check to make sure the contact information is current on a yearly basis—but we do not have the capacity as a legal office to make sure they are 100% up-to-date.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>If you would like a social service referral in the community to which you are returning</strong> (for example, you are looking for food, housing, employment or workforce development services, public benefits enrollment, health care, reentry support, legal aid services, etc.), OR <strong>believe you know of agencies and services that we don’t</strong>, please feel free to write Root &amp; Rebound a letter at the following mailing address: 1730 Franklin St., Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94612, or call our Reentry Legal Hotline any Friday, from 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., at phone number (510) 279-4662 (we accept Collect Calls). You may ask for resources for all counties you are interested in, and we will send you the information that we have in our office. In addition to contacting our office, you can also try some of the following statewide resources listed below for referrals.</p>
        <p class="text">Finally, we have listed here some resources that are specific to certain populations, which may be helpful, and which you may write or call us to request.</p>
