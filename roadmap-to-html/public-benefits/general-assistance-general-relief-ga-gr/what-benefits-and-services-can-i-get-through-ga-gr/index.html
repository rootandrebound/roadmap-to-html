        <h1>What benefits and services can I get through GA/GR?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county offers different benefits and services through GA/GR, and every county sets its own specific rules. Generally, every county’s GA/GR program provides a monthly cash amount. But remember that the rules vary by county:</p>
        <ol class="text">Each county has its own rules for calculating a person’s monthly GA/GR amount—typically based on factors like whether you’re married, your housing situation, disabilities, ability to work, and ability to apply for other public benefits programs.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Some counties’ GA/GR programs provide help with: </ol>
        <ol class="text">Transportation costs;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Health care and nutrition needs;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Substance abuse treatment referrals;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Emergency food and housing;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Housing repairs; and/or</ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">MORE INFORMATION ON “UNEMPLOYABLE APPLICANTS”</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled.</p>
        <ul class="sidebox">Unemployable GA/GR recipients who are applying for Social Security or SSI can also receive representation or assistance in their applications.Contact your county welfare agency if you need to find out exactly what benefits and services it offers and which rules apply for General Assistance/General Relief. </ul>
        <ol class="text">Personal hygiene products.</ol>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR GA/GR: The difference between a <em>grant</em> and a <em>loan: </em>Some counties provide GA/GR cash as a “grant” (a gift), with no strings attached; other counties provide GA/GR as a “loan.” If your county treats GA/GR as a loan, you will have to pay it back if you have enough income to do so. Several counties require anyone who receives GA/GR, but is then later approved for Social Security Benefits, to repay GA/GR benefits. For more information on Social Security Benefits, see PG. 473. Also, many counties have rules that limit the number of months that you can get GA/GR benefits throughout the year.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc290125855"></a><a id="_Toc352861520"></a>How do I apply for GA/GR? </h3>
        <p class="text"><a id="_Toc290728746"></a>You must apply for General Assistance/General Relief in person. If you have a disability that stops you from going into the county welfare office, you can request help. Contact your county welfare agency for details about the application process in your county. For a directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, PG. 499. Note that some counties accept GA/GR applications only at specific offices, so if you are unsure about which office to go to, you should call the main county welfare office and ask. </p>
        <p class="text">Note that you can apply for General Assistance/General Relief at the same time you apply for CalFresh (“food stamps”) and/or Medi-Cal (health insurance for low-income Californians), and it is usually a good idea to do so. Some counties may allow you to apply for General Assistance/General Relief upon release or at a community re-entry center. See more information about CalFresh on PG. 449 and Medi-Cal on PG. 461.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc290125856"></a><a id="_Toc352861521"></a>Can I apply for GA/GR while incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">No. You are not eligible to apply for GA/GR while in jail or prison. But remember that you may be eligible to apply once you are released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1434" id="footnote-ref-1434">[1433]</a></sup> If you are on house arrest, contact your county welfare agency to ask if you are eligible for GA/GR.<sup><a href="#footnote-1435" id="footnote-ref-1435">[1434]</a></sup> </p>
