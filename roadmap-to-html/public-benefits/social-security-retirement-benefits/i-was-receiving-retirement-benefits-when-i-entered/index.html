        <h1>I was receiving retirement benefits when I entered prison or jail. What happens to them while I‚Äôm incarcerated?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you were convicted and incarcerated for 30 or more days in a row, your Social Security benefits got suspended on the 31st day.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1646" id="footnote-ref-1646">[1645]</a></sup></sup> You can‚Äôt get these benefits while incarcerated, but you‚Äôll stay enrolled in the program. This means if your spouse or children have been getting benefits based on your Social Security eligibility, they‚Äôll keep getting them while you‚Äôre incarcerated (even if your benefits were suspended), so long as they‚Äôre eligible.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1647" id="footnote-ref-1647">[1646]</a></sup></sup> This also means that once you have official documents proving your release date, you can apply to restart your retirement benefits (see PG.¬†476).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1648" id="footnote-ref-1648">[1647]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Please note that BEFORE you are actually convicted‚Äîeven if you are incarcerated while awaiting trial‚Äîyou will continue to receive Social Security benefits until you are convicted AND incarcerated for 30 days or more in a row.<sup><a href="#footnote-1649" id="footnote-ref-1649">[1648]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="textbox">IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONSExceptions for People Incarcerated Before April 1, 2000‚Äî<br/>What happened to your Social Security Benefits during incarceration:</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">If you were incarcerated before February 1, 1995: Your benefits get suspended after your 31<sup>st</sup> day of incarceration only if you were convicted of a felony. If you were incarcerated between February 1, 1995 and March 31, 2000: You‚Äôre not entitled to benefits for any month in which you were incarcerated following conviction for a crime that can be given a one-year or longer sentence by law (regardless of the actual sentence the court imposed). If you were incarcerated before April 1, 2000: Your benefits don‚Äôt get suspended if you‚Äôre confined by court order because you‚Äôre found ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù due to insanity, ‚Äúguilty‚Äù but insane, or ‚Äúincompetent to stand trial.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-1650" id="footnote-ref-1650">[1649]</a></sup></ul>
