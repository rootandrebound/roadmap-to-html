        <h1>My retirement benefits stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart them?</h1>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Before release:</span></p>
        <ol class="text">Once you know your release date, notify your correctional counselor (or another staff member at your facility) that you want to restart your Social Security benefits. It‚Äôs best to start this process at least 3 months before your release date.<sup><a href="#footnote-1651" id="footnote-ref-1651">[1650]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">If your facility has a pre-release agreement:</ol>
        <ol class="text">should be available to help you complete and submit the necessary paperwork in a timely way.<sup><a href="#footnote-1652" id="footnote-ref-1652">[1651]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If your facility doesn‚Äôt offer prerelease assistance‚Äîand or you have trouble working with staff:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to notify Social Security that you were getting retirement benefits before you got incarcerated, and you want your benefits to restart as soon as possible after your release. The toll-free line is open Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Be prepared to provide your Social Security number and release date. A representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to provide official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.<sup><a href="#footnote-1653" id="footnote-ref-1653">[1652]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If Social Security‚Äôs automated phone system doesn‚Äôt accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (‚ÄúAR‚Äù) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix¬†G PG.¬†512 to appoint a family member as an AR).</ol>
        <ol class="text">You can also ask a friend, family member, or trusted advocate to communicate with Social Security about your benefits on your behalf. Remember that you have a right to appoint any individual‚Äîsuch as a friend, family member, attorney, or social worker‚Äîto act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the form in Appendix¬†G on PG.¬†517.<sup><a href="#footnote-1654" id="footnote-ref-1654">[1653]</a></sup> </ol>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">After release:</span></p>
        <ol class="text"> Call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to notify Social Security that you were released from prison and want to restart your retirement benefits. Be prepared to provide your Social Security number. A representative will set an appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.<sup><a href="#footnote-1655" id="footnote-ref-1655">[1654]</a></sup> </ol>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You can‚Äôt get back-payments of Social Security for the months you spent in prison or jail.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1656" id="footnote-ref-1656">[1655]</a></sup></sup> In other words, you can never collect retirement checks you otherwise would have gotten if you weren‚Äôt incarcerated. However, you should be able to collect back-payments dating back to the month following the month of your release. For example, if you were released on October 10, 2014, you can start receiving retirement benefits again starting November 2014. Since monthly Social Security benefits are paid 1 month after they‚Äôre due, you can collect your November retirement check in December 2014.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1657" id="footnote-ref-1657">[1656]</a></sup></sup></p>

        <h4 class="sidebox">NOTES RELATED TO ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER BENEFITS:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you get SSDI, after your 24<sup>th</sup> month of benefits you‚Äôll be automatically enrolled in Medicare (see PG.¬†466).If you get SSDI, benefits may also be available to certain family members, including: (1) your spouse, if he/she is age 62 or older, or caring for your child who is under 16 and has a disability; and (2) your unmarried child, if he/she is under age 18, or age 18 or older and has a disability that started before age 22 (see PG.¬†477).Depending on your work history, you may also be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits (see PG.¬†473).Depending on how much income and resources you have, you may also be eligible for SSI (see PG.¬†481).</p>
