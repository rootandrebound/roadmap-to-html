        <h1>Am I legally required to enroll in health care coverage?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you live in the U.S., and you‚Äôre <em>not currently incarcerated</em>, the answer is probably <em>yes</em>. <a id="PB_HealthCare_IndividualMandate"></a>Certain people in special situations (explained below) are excused from this requirement. Unless you have one of these situations, you MUST enroll in health care coverage, or else you must pay a penalty fee when you file taxes.<sup><a href="#footnote-1510" id="footnote-ref-1510">[1509]</a></sup> This legal requirement is called the ‚Äúindividual mandate,‚Äù and the tax penalty is called the ‚Äúshared responsibility fee.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-1511" id="footnote-ref-1511">[1510]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><a id="PublicBenefits_HealthCare_ExceptionManda"></a><strong><em>Exemptions to the Individual Mandate:</em></strong> If you qualify for an exemption, you don‚Äôt have to pay a penalty even if you don‚Äôt have health care coverage. You may qualify for an exemption if one of the following situations applies to you:<sup><a href="#footnote-1512" id="footnote-ref-1512">[1511]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Currently incarcerated:</span> You‚Äôre currently in jail or prison serving a sentence for a conviction. This doesn‚Äôt include being held for a case that‚Äôs still pending‚Äîfor example, you‚Äôve been charged but not yet convicted.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Short coverage gap:</span> Your uninsured period is shorter than 3 months (back-to-back) during the year.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Not lawfully present:</span> You don‚Äôt have citizenship or lawful immigrant status in the U.S.<sup><a href="#footnote-1513" id="footnote-ref-1513">[1512]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Not required to file taxes:</span> You‚Äôre not legally required to file a tax return because your income is too low.<sup><a href="#footnote-1514" id="footnote-ref-1514">[1513]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Unable to afford coverage:</span> You can‚Äôt afford the cheapest coverage available to you, because it would cost more than 8% of your household income.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Indian tribe:</span> You belong to a federally recognized Indian tribe, or you‚Äôre eligible for services through an Indian Health Services provider.<sup><a href="#footnote-1515" id="footnote-ref-1515">[1514]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Sharing ministry:</span> You‚Äôre a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Religious conscience:</span> You‚Äôre a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Hardship:</span> You‚Äôve had financial or domestic difficulties that kept you from enrolling in health care, such as homelessness, a death in the family, bankruptcy, a medical emergency, or a natural disaster. Filing for a hardship requires you to fill out special forms. </ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">A Note About Individual Mandate Exemptions</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Even if you qualify for an exemption, you still can apply and get health care coverage to help pay for medical expenses. An exemption just means that you don‚Äôt have to pay the penalty fee‚Äîcalled the ‚Äúshared responsibility fee‚Äù‚Äîif you one of the exemption situations applies to you, and you don‚Äôt get health care coverage.</p>
        <p class="text">For most of these situations, you must apply to get an exemption. The process varies by situation. </p>
        <p class="text">If you have questions about the forms you need, or if you aren‚Äôt sure how to get an exemption for your situation, call Covered California at 1-800-300-1506 (TTY 1-888-889-4500) or the federal government‚Äôs Health Insurance Marketplace at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY 1-855-889-4325). Or you may try calling Health Consumer Alliance (HCA), a non-profit organization dedicated to providing information about and helping Californians to get health care.
