        <h1>Can I get health care through Covered California while I‚Äôm incarcerated?</h1>
        <p class="text">No. You cannot get health care through Covered California while you are incarcerated, but you may apply for Medi-Cal once you are nearing your release date (more information on Medi-Cal starting on PG.¬†461). Or if you prefer to have private health care through Covered California, you may apply once you are released (see below for more details).</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintIf you‚Äôre currently serving a sentence in jail or prison, special rules apply to you for applying for health insurance:<sup><a href="#footnote-1537" id="footnote-ref-1537">[1536]</a></sup></h4>
        <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">While you‚Äôre incarcerated:</span></p>
        <ul class="textbox">You <em>are eligible </em>to enroll in Medi-Cal while incarcerated. You may apply on your own, or through any enrollment program available at your facility.<sup><a href="#footnote-1538" id="footnote-ref-1538">[1537]</a></sup> You can‚Äôt start using a Medi-Cal health care plan while you‚Äôre incarcerated; but if you enroll before your release, you may be able to get health care more quickly once you‚Äôre out.<sup><a href="#footnote-1539" id="footnote-ref-1539">[1538]</a></sup> To learn more about Medi-Cal and how to enroll while incarcerated, go to PG.¬†461. You <em>are</em> <em>not eligible</em> to buy a private health care plan through Covered California, and the Individual Mandate (see PG.¬†457) doesn‚Äôt apply to you as long as you‚Äôre incarcerated following a criminal conviction. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about paying a penalty, or applying for an exemption from the penalty, during your incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1540" id="footnote-ref-1540">[1539]</a></sup></ul>
        <p class="textbox"><a id="PublicBenefits_HealthCare_After_Incarcer"></a><span class="emphasisitalic">Once you‚Äôre released:</span>You may be eligible to enroll in health care through Covered California; and the Individual Mandate (see PG.¬†457) may now apply to you. This means you may now be legally required to have health care, or pay a tax penalty‚Äîunless you get an exemption (read more about exemptions on PG.¬†458).</p>
        <ul class="textbox">If you want to enroll in Medi-Cal, and you didn‚Äôt already enroll while incarcerated, you can apply at any time after your release. For details about Medi-Cal, go to PG.¬†461.If you want to buy a private health care plan (and also get tax credits to help pay for it), you have 60 days after your release to notify Covered California, get approved for a Special Enrollment Period (see PG.¬†459), submit a Covered California application, and enroll in a health care plan. If you don‚Äôt complete this process in 60 days, you must wait for the next Open Enrollment period (see PG.¬†458), and you may have to pay a penalty.<sup><a href="#footnote-1541" id="footnote-ref-1541">[1540]</a></sup> </ul>
        <li id="footnote-1537"><p> Note: These special rules do not apply to you if you are on probation, parole, or home confinement; or if you are being ‚Äúdetained pre-trial‚Äù‚Äîin other words, being held in jail or prison but have not yet been convicted of a crime.

Also, please note that at the time of production of the ‚ÄúRoadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide,‚Äù the California Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) was drafting new rules that would allow for applications prior to some ‚Äúqualifying life events,‚Äù including release from incarceration.
