        <h1>my spouse wants a divorce and i am incarcerated. how will i be notified? what should i do?</h1>
        <p class="text">You will likely receive paperwork through the mail, which will include the Summons, and Petition legal papers that were filed by your former spouse. You will also receive a form called the ‚ÄúNotice and Acknowledgment of Receipt‚Äù (FL-117). This form asks if you would like to ‚Äúwaive‚Äù (meaning give up) your right to be served with future papers. If you do not agree to give up this right, then your spouse seeking the divorce will have to arrange for someone to serve future papers related to the divorce to you personally (usually someone you spouse hires or someone in law enforcement).</p>
        <p class="text">Once you have received this paperwork, you will have 30 days to respond.<sup><a href="#footnote-2506" id="footnote-ref-2506">[2505]</a></sup> For steps on how to respond, please see Appendix¬†K on PG.¬†813. Unfortunately, however, there is no law saying you have the right to be present at the court hearing‚Äîunless there will be a potential change in your rights as a parent).<sup><a href="#footnote-2507" id="footnote-ref-2507">[2506]</a></sup> BUT you can still respond! You should still respond to the petition within 30 days if you disagree with something that is included in the paperwork filed by your spouse‚Äîfor example, see Appendix¬†K on PG.¬†813, for reasons why you could disagree with the petition. </p>

        <p class="text">Many people coming home from prison or jail are surprised to find they owe lots of money to various courts, agencies, and people. The money you owe can make it very hard to get back on your feet, which can leave you feeling frustrated and discouraged. In this section, we will walk you through the different types of court ordered debts that a judge can order you to pay to support your children or spouse.</p>

        <p class="text">In the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG.¬†650, we explain the types of court-ordered debts you may owe because of criminal justice system involvement. Examples of these debts include: <em>restitution; court fines and penalties; administrative fees; and traffic fines and fees</em>.</p>
        <p class="text">There are a <em>other court-ordered debts</em> we do not cover in that chapter because these debts are specific to court orders involving your child(ren) or former spouse. Here we provide you with an overview of family-related court-ordered debts, specifically <strong>child support</strong> and <strong>spousal support</strong>. </p>
