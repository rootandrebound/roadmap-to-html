        <h1>What can I do to show mitigating circumstances and rehabilitative evidence related to my criminal record?</h1>
        <h4 class="sidebox">What is a 388 petition?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Under Welfare and Institutions Code 388, any parent of a dependent child, a dependent child of the juvenile court (with the assistance of an appointed guardian), or other person having interest in a dependent child of the juvenile court may file a 388 petition when there is a change of circumstance or there is new evidence in their case. For more information on 388 petitions, see Appendix E on PG.¬†794.</p>
        <p class="text">As stated in the family court section on PG.¬†740, You can show the judge anything that indicates that giving you custody or visitation will be in the best interests of your child. You can show the judge things like: certificates earned during incarceration, letters to and from your child, letters of support from family and friends, documents that show attendance in self-help groups, proof of employment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2435" id="footnote-ref-2435">[2434]</a></sup> However, if you have a conviction that automatically bans you from getting custody or visitation with your child, then mitigating evidence will not be considered. See PG.¬†719 for a list of convictions that will automatically bar you from getting custody or visitation.</p>
