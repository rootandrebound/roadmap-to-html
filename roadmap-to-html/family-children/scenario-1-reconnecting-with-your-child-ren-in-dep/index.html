        <h1>Scenario 1: Reconnecting with your Child(ren) in Dependency Court</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc317247527"></a><a id="_Toc352861889"></a>Why would i go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with my child? </h3>
        <p class="text">You would go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with your child or grandchild if CPS is involved in investigating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. As a parent, that could mean your child was taken away from you or the child’s caregiver. You would attend juvenile court proceedings to try and resolve the allegations of abuse and neglect.<sup><a href="#footnote-2414" id="footnote-ref-2414">[2413]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">A grandparent could be involved either because the grandparent is accused of abuse or neglect or the grandparent wants to become the child’s guardian while the investigation by CPS continues.<sup><a href="#footnote-2415" id="footnote-ref-2415">[2414]</a></sup></p>
