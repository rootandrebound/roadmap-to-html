        <h1>Can I get rid of my past, overdue child support debt?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends, but probably not entirely.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt (‚Äúarrears‚Äù) is <em>different</em> than the process for changing your CURRENT child support payment amount. This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt. To learn about changing your <em>current</em> child support payments, see PG.¬†774.</p>
        <p class="text">This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue </em>child support debt.</p>
        <h4 class="step">First, figure out whether you owe overdue child support payments to the other parent (or caregiver) or to the state.</h4>
        <p class="text">To find out, you can contact the LCSA and ask for a breakdown (detailed list) of your arrears. This will show how much you owe to the other parent and/or to the state. The chart below can also help you figure out whom you owe child support to‚Äîbut it‚Äôs always best to get a breakdown from the LCSA to be sure!</p>
        <h4 class="step">Once you know whom you owe money to, use the following chart to figure out your next steps:</h4>

You may not receive a refund for any of the COAP payments that you‚Äôve already made, and you will be unable to reapply to the COAP program for 2 years.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2559" id="footnote-ref-2559">[2558]</a></sup></sup></p></td><td><p class="text">If you reach an agreement with the other parent, you should make sure to put it in writing for the LCSA and the judge.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2560" id="footnote-ref-2560">[2559]</a></sup></sup></p></td></tr></table>
