        <h1>Becoming a Guardian with a Record through Dependency Court</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc317247545"></a><a id="_Toc352861908"></a>What is a juvenile court guardianship? </h3>
        <p class="text">Legal guardianship is a court order saying that a certain adult—someone who is not the child’s parent—is in charge of taking care of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2448" id="footnote-ref-2448">[2447]</a></sup></sup> Guardians have many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as parents do while the guardianship is in place. They can make decisions about where the child lives, the child’s health care, and where the child goes to school.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2449" id="footnote-ref-2449">[2448]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">Remember! In California, there are <em>2 kinds of legal guardianships</em>: (1) <em>probate</em> guardianships and (2) <em>juvenile dependency</em> guardianships. </p>
        <p class="text">Many guardianships are set up through the probate court, not in juvenile dependency court. If your child is NOT a dependent of the juvenile court, you may want to read about probate guardianships on PG.  741. NOTE: A guardian who was appointed through dependency court has the <em>same responsibilities</em> as a guardian appointed in probate court, although they do not have an automatic duty to provide status reports to the court at least once a year. Guardians through dependency court still have the following responsibilities. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>A guardian through dependency court is responsible for the following for the dependent child:</em></strong></p>
        <ol class="text">Health care: You can make medical decisions for the child. You can give permission for most medical and dental treatments, and for counseling or therapy. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Education: You can choose the child’s school and learning program. If he/she needs special education, you can work with the school to write an individualized education program (“IEP”).</ol>
        <ol class="text">Social services: You can get help for the child from programs such as Head Start, Regional Centers (for children with developmental disabilities), California Children’s Services (for children with physical disabilities or certain medical conditions), and after-school programs.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Residence: You can decide where the child lives.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2450" id="footnote-ref-2450">[2449]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Financial support: You can choose to support the child by yourself; or, if you want help, you can ask for welfare, foster care payments, or other help.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2451" id="footnote-ref-2451">[2450]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Marriage: You and the court must give permission for the child to get married if he/she wants to do so while under 18.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Armed forces: You can give permission for the child to join the armed forces if he/she is under 18.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Driver’s License: You can give permission for the child to apply for a driver’s license. You’ll have to pay for any damage if he/she gets in an accident, and you must get insurance to cover the child. If you change your mind, you can sign a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to cancel the child’s license.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Misconduct: You can be sued for money damages if the child does something wrong.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Other responsibilities: The judge can ask you to take on other responsibilities. For example, the judge can set up visits for the child with his/her parents or sisters/brothers.</ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc317247546"></a><a id="_Toc352861909"></a>Who can be a child’s legal guardian in dependency court? </h3>
        <p class="text">Guardians can be grandparents, brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, other relatives, foster parents, family friends, or others who know the child. A guardian doesn’t have to be blood-related to the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2452" id="footnote-ref-2452">[2451]</a></sup></sup></p>

            <p class="text"><em>First, the bad news:</em> If the child is NOT living with you right now, before the judge can make you the child’s guardian and allow the child to live with you, the court staff (or a county social worker) must run a background check on you AND any other adults who live in your home or who will spend significant time with the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2453" id="footnote-ref-2453">[2452]</a></sup></sup> If you (or any other adult who gets checked) have a criminal record, the judge will not allow the child to live with you UNLESS you get a “criminal record exemption” from the county social service agency.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2454" id="footnote-ref-2454">[2453]</a></sup></sup> A criminal record exemption means you must get the county social service agency to excuse your conviction and not hold it against you in the process of becoming the child’s guardian through dependency court.</p>
            <h5 class="question">What convictions can I <em>NOT</em> get an “exemption” for?</h5>
            <p class="text">Unfortunately, many convictions are considered <em>“non-exemptible,”</em> which means if you or anyone in your home has a <em>non-exemptible conviction</em> on your criminal record, the judge will NOT allow the child to live with you, even if living with you would otherwise be good for the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2455" id="footnote-ref-2455">[2454]</a></sup></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Non-exemptible convictions include:</span> A FELONY conviction for child abuse, child neglect, spousal abuse, other crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a crime involving violence (including rape, sexual assault, and homicide), and a felony conviction <em>within the last 5 years</em> for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-2456" id="footnote-ref-2456">[2455]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: </span>BUT—and this is a big BUT—if the child is <em>already</em> living in your home, the judge can allow the child to continue living with you, <em>even if</em> you or someone else in the home has a “non-exemptible” conviction, especially if the child is doing well there.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2457" id="footnote-ref-2457">[2456]</a></sup></sup></p>

            <ul class="learn-bullets">The types of cases that are in juvenile delinquency court.How a child’s case in juvenile delinquency court could affect your parent rights and your ability to reconnect with your child in reentry.Whether your criminal record could affect your child’s case in juvenile delinquency court.</ul>
            <p class="text">The following is a brief overview of juvenile delinquency court cases. We only include the basics because Root &amp; Rebound is focused on providing information to people who are in reentry from prison and jail, and navigating legal issues with a criminal record. In general, we do not focus on situations in which a person is actively being charged with a crime in criminal or juvenile delinquency court. But because many people in reentry have children involved in the juvenile justice system, we are including a brief overview here to provide parents with some very basic information. If you have a child involved in a juvenile delinquency case, we recommend you speak with the juvenile delinquency court that is handling your child’s case, and your child’s attorney.</p>
            <li id="footnote-2453"><p> Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code § 361.4. The background checks will include both criminal records and child abuse, and may also be conducted on any person over age 14 living in your home if the social worker believes that person may have a criminal record. <a href="#footnote-ref-2453">↑</a></p></li>
            <li id="footnote-2454"><p> To get a criminal record exemption, you must show strong evidence of your good character, such that living with you will be in the child’s best interest AND will not put the child at risk of harm.

App. 4th 1161, 1168 (2001), review denied. The complete list of non-exemptible offenses is contained in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code § 1522(g). However, certain offenses are “non-exemptible only under specified circumstances,” and the Director of Social Services may have discretion to grant an exemption for an offense that otherwise would be non-exemptible. See In re Esperanza C., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1042, 1057 (2008). In addition, some counties may not have authority to issue an exemption, which means the judge cannot place a child in a home where any person has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation.

In re Miguel E., 120 Cal. App. 4th 521 (2004). However, if the child was allowed to live with relative as an emergency placement, the welfare agency can remove the child if it later finds that any adult living in the home has a criminal record.

            <p class="text">There are two types of cases that end up in juvenile delinquency court: they are called “601 petitions” and “602 petitions”.<sup><a href="#footnote-2458" id="footnote-ref-2458">[2457]</a></sup></p>
            <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">601 petitions:</span> The county’s probation department files 601 petitions based on crimes that are only illegal when someone is a child under the age of 18. This includes things such as breaking curfew, skipping school, running away, or disobeying parents. If the court finds a child under the age of 18 guilty of one of these offenses, the child is called a “status offender.” <sup><a href="#footnote-2459" id="footnote-ref-2459">[2458]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">602 petitions:</span> The District Attorney’s office files 602 petitions based on crimes that would still be illegal even if the child were 18 years or older. These types of crimes include both felonies and misdemeanors. If the court finds the child guilty of these types of crimes, it is called an “adjudication” (instead of a “conviction,” which is the term used to describe crimes that people are found guilty of in the adult criminal court system). A child who has an “adjudication” is called a “delinquent” to describe their legal status. <sup><a href="#footnote-2460" id="footnote-ref-2460">[2459]</a></sup></ol>
            <p class="text">In juvenile delinquency court, they have hearings called “fitness” hearings (sometimes called “waiver” hearings), where the judge decides if the child is “unfit” for juvenile delinquency court. If the child is found “unfit” for juvenile court, the child’s case will be held in adult criminal court, with adult punishments. Children can only be found “unfit” for juvenile delinquency court, and have their case sent to adult criminal court, if they were <em>14 or older</em> at the time of the alleged offense. </p>

            <p class="text">Adoption is the <em>legal process</em> of forming a legally recognized parent-child relationship when you are <em>not</em> the child's biological or birth parent. Adoptive parents have ALL the same legal rights and responsibilities that a biological parent would have had. That adoptive parent-child relationship is permanent and is seen as exactly the same as that of a birth family under the law. An adoptive parent can be a stepparent or domestic partner of one of the birth parents, a relative of the child who has been caring for the child, or someone unrelated to the child by blood. For more information on adoption and how to adopt a child, visit the following website: <a href="http://www.childsworld.ca.gov/pg1302.htm">http://www.childsworld.ca.gov/pg1302.htm</a>.</p>

            <p class="text">Anyone who applies to adopt a child will have to provide a lot of documentation, including a state criminal record and fingerprints that will be run though the California Department of Justice’s (CA DOJ) state database and the FBI’s federal database.<sup><a href="#footnote-2467" id="footnote-ref-2467">[2466]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">It depends on your past conviction(s) and the past conviction(s) of anyone else living in the adoptive home.<sup><a href="#footnote-2468" id="footnote-ref-2468">[2467]</a></sup> If your past conviction was related to the abuse or neglect of a child, or was for a violent offense, the judge may not allow you to adopt. If you were convicted of abuse or neglect or a violent offense, it you should talk to a lawyer about whether you will still be able to legally adopt a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2469" id="footnote-ref-2469">[2468]</a></sup> Because the judge is determining what is in the best interest of the child, convictions related to child abuse or neglect will likely bar you from adopting a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2470" id="footnote-ref-2470">[2469]</a></sup> </p>
            <ol class="text"><strong>&gt; Convictions that will <em>AUTOMATICALLY</em> Ban You from Adopting a Child:</strong></ol>
            <p class="text">Whether you are going through an adoption agency, family court, or juvenile dependency court, under state law you may <em>not</em> adopt a child if you have a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, any crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a violent crime such as rape, sexual assault, or homicide).<sup><a href="#footnote-2471" id="footnote-ref-2471">[2470]</a></sup> You also may not adopt a child if you have a felony conviction within the last 5 years for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense (in other words, you will have to wait 5 years <em>after</em> the date of your conviction to be able to adopt a child in California).<sup><a href="#footnote-2472" id="footnote-ref-2472">[2471]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">So regardless of whether it is a court or an adoption agency reviewing your record, you will not be approved as an adoptive parent if one of the above bans applies.</p>
            <ol class="text"><strong>&gt; Convictions that <em>MIGHT</em> Ban You from Adopting a Child:</strong></ol>
            <p class="text">The question above explained state law that <em>automatically</em> prevents people with certain convictions from adopting a child, no matter if it is a court or an adoption agency making the decision.</p>
            <p class="text">In addition to those convictions, a family court, dependency court, and/or an adoption agency will also screen and consider the following factors about you:</p>
            <ol class="text">How you’ve dealt with difficult or stressful life situations in the past; </ol>
            <ol class="text">Relationships within your family;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Ability to take over the responsibility for the care, guidance, and protection of a child;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Emotional flexibility and stability;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Self-esteem;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Coping ability;</ol>
            <ol class="text">How you accept normal hazards and risks;<strong> </strong></ol>
            <ol class="text">Motivation for adoption;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your ability to have a parent-child relationship and to enjoy life with a child;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Flexibility regarding your expectations of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2473" id="footnote-ref-2473">[2472]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Social background;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Educational background;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Financial stability;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Work adjustment; and</ol>
            <ol class="text">Adequacy of housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2474" id="footnote-ref-2474">[2473]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <p class="text">In sum, courts and adoption agencies review every adoption application individually. Your conviction history will be one factor, but depending on your current situation and efforts at rehabilitation, you may still be able to adopt (unless you have a conviction on the list of ones that <em>automatically</em> prevent you from adopting, on PG. 719).</p>
