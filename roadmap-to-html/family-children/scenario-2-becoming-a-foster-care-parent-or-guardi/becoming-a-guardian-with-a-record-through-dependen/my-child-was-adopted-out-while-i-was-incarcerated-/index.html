        <h1>My child was adopted out while I was incarcerated. What can I do to reconnect?</h1>
        <p class="text">If your child was adopted while you were incarcerated, you should have received notice (in writing, on official court papers) of this adoption. Although you are incarcerated, you had the right to be present at any hearing where your parental rights could be terminated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2475" id="footnote-ref-2475">[2474]</a></sup> If you were not notified and your child was given up for adoption, talk to a lawyer IMMEDIATELY to discuss your rights and what can be done.</p>
        <p class="text">A lawyer may be able to help you draft an agreement with the adoptive parents so that you can continue to have contact with your child. This may be a formal agreement in writing and filed in court OR an informal agreement between you and the adoptive parents.<sup><a href="#footnote-2476" id="footnote-ref-2476">[2475]</a></sup> A family lawyer can advise you on which is the better solution.</p>
