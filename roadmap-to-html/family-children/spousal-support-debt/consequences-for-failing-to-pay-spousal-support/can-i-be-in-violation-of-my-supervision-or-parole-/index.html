        <h1>Can I be in violation of my supervision or parole if I fail to pay spousal support?</h1>
        <p class="text">Every person on parole and supervision is subjected to a set of general conditions, one of which is the prohibition of carrying out any illegal activities (see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG.¬†125, for more information about the conditions that apply to your specific type of supervision).</p>
        <p class="text">Although not paying your spousal support is not a crime in and of itself, if a judge determines that you have the resources to pay, but are willfully refusing to do so, you might be found in contempt of court. This is a criminal charge that would amount to a parole violation.</p>
