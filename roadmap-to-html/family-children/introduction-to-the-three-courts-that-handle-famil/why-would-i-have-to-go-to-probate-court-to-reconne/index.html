        <h1>Why would I have to go to probate court to reconnect with my child or grandchild?</h1>
        <p class="text">People go to probate court seeking to become a child’s legal guardian and must file a “petition” (a legal request) to do so.</p>
        <p class="text">In reentry, you might become involved in a probate case to:</p>
        <ol class="text">Become a guardian (non-parents only);</ol>
        <ol class="text">End a guardianship set up while you were incarcerated or away for other reasons (parents only, who are looking to get their parental rights <em>back</em>); OR</ol>
        <ol class="text">Support someone else becoming a guardian for your child (parents only).</ol>
        <p class="text">To <em>become a guardian</em>, you have to open a case in probate court. But to <em>end a guardianship or support someone else becoming your child’s guardian</em>, you will have to JOIN his or her open probate court case.</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">A Special Note for Grandparents: </span>This information is very important for grandparents because probate court will be the court you will want to file a “petition” if there is no ongoing case involving your grandchild and you want to become his or her guardian. Remember! Grandparents’ don’t have automatic rights to care for a grandchild (learn more about your rights on PG. 720.</p>
