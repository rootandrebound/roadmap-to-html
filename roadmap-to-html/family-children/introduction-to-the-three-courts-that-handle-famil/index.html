        <h1>Introduction to the Three Courts that Handle Family & Children Matters</h1>
        <p class="text">This section will explain the three courts in California that make legal decisions about family issues and the care of children. Just because your situation <em>seems to fit into the description of cases that happen in one type of court…</em>does not mean the case will definitely be heard and decided by a judge in that court. </p>
        <p class="text">Family law cases can be long, complicated, and difficult to navigate. Every case is different and every county handles cases dealing with family and children a little bit differently. It can even vary by<em> judge</em> within the <em>same</em> county!</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">But don’t let this overwhelm you.</span> There are people you can contact to get help with your family law situation so you do not have figure things out alone:</p>
        <ol class="text">First, there are <strong>Family Law/Self-Help Centers</strong> in every county that can help you decide which court to go to, where to file your forms, and what kinds of documents to show as evidence.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Second, you can also read this Chapter and call <strong>Root &amp; Rebound’s</strong> <strong>Reentry Hotline</strong> (any Friday, 9AM – 5PM, at phone number 510-279-4662) for more information about <em>reunifying with your children</em> or working through a family law case when you have a criminal record. We accept Collect Calls.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Third, for a list of <strong>legal aid offices</strong> in your region of California that may be able to help you, see PG. 1075.</ol>
