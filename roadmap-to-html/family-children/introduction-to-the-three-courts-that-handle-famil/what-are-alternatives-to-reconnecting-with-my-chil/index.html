        <h1>What are alternatives to reconnecting with my child/grandchild without going to family court?</h1>
        <p class="text">Below we describe other ways you can reconnect with your child without going to family court:</p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Informal Custody or Visitation Plan:</span> Parents and caregivers can make their own arrangements for custody and visitation without going to court. But, if the parents or caregivers can no longer agree on an arrangement for the care of the child then one or both of the parents or caregivers will have to go to court to ask a judge for a formal custody or visitation plan. This formal plan will be binding and enforceable as a court order.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2378" id="footnote-ref-2378">[2377]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Mediation:</span> Before granting or changing custody or visitation for your child, the judge will hold a hearing. The judge may require you and the other parent to attend mediation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2379" id="footnote-ref-2379">[2378]</a></sup> </sup>Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution (known as ADR) method to help people resolve their disputes without having to spend time and money going to court. In mediation, the parents or caregivers have the help of an expert (a mediator) in resolving these disagreements. The goals of mediation are to:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Help you make a parenting plan that is in the best interest of your children.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Help you make a parenting plan that lets your children spend time with both parents.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Help you learn ways to deal with anger or resentment.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2380" id="footnote-ref-2380">[2379]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Mediation can be voluntary (by choice) or ordered (required) by the court. For more information on mediation in family court, see Appendix B (and for more information, see Form FL-314-INFO, “Child Custody Information Sheet – Child Custody Mediation,” available online at: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl314info.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl314info.pdf</a>).</ol>

        <p class="importantbox"><a id="FamilyChildren_GuardianResponsibilities"></a>IMPORTANT REMINDER: If you have a restraining order or no-contact against you of any kind, make sure you follow the conditions of that order BEFORE you attempt to contact your child’s caregiver or other parents to make sure you do not violate the order! If you are UNSURE if you have an order against you, see PG. 721 on how to find out if there is an order against you and what you can and cannot do. </p>

        <h4 class="textbox">What will I learn about probate court?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">What probate court is.Why you would need to go to probate court to reconnect with your child or grandchild, and why this is especially important for grandparentsYour rights and responsibilities as a child’s legal guardian.The difference between a guardianship, adoption, and foster care.How to end a guardianship to get your parental rights back in reentry.How a judge’s decisions in probate court can affect your rights as a parent.Your rights as a parent if you have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of your child.How and why you would go to probate court to become the guardian of someone else’s child, and how going to probate court could help you financially to take care of someone else’s child.How a probate court judge will decide if you should be the guardian of someone else’s child.How your criminal record may affect your chances of being appointed as the guardian for someone else’s child.How you can show a judge in probate court that you being appointed the guardian is in the “best interest of the child.”Alternatives to becoming a guardian through the probate court.</ul>
        <p class="text">This section goes into TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS about probate guardianships:</p>
        <ol class="text">If you were formerly incarcerated and now want to END a probate guardianship set up for your child <em>by someone else</em> while you were away.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you were formerly incarcerated and want to BECOME the probate guardian of someone else’s child, and have questions about how your record will impact your ability to do so.</ol>
        <p class="text"><em>Note:</em> A parent would never become the guardian for his or her own child—only a non-parent becomes a “guardian” for someone else’s child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2381" id="footnote-ref-2381">[2380]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><em>If </em><strong><em>Child Protective Service (CPS)</em></strong><em> is involved in the child’s case, you probably have to go to juvenile dependency court. See PG. 747 to learn more.</em></p>
