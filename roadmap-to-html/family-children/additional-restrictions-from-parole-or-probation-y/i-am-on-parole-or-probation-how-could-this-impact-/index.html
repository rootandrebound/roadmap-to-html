        <h1>I am on parole or probation. How could this impact my ability to reconnect with my child or grandchild?</h1>
        <p class="text">In addition to ‚Äúno-contact‚Äù conditions (read more on PG.¬†730), you may have travel restrictions placed on you by parole or probation that limit your ability to reconnect with your child or grandchild.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Travel Restrictions </strong>could make it difficult for you to <em>visit</em> your child or grandchild, especially if he or she lives in another county. If you have limits on where or how far you can travel, you should talk to your parole agent or probation officer and request a <strong><em>travel pass</em></strong>‚Äîand make sure you get <span class="emphasisitalic">approval in writing</span>! Alternatively, you can arrange with family, friends, a case manager or mentor, parole officer, or through the court (by requesting a change in the conditions of your supervision) for your child or grandchild to come visit you. Always check with your parole agent or probation officer if you are unsure if you have any travel restrictions. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Transfer Restrictions</strong>: There may also be limitations on your ability to transfer your parole location to certain counties for a number of reasons‚Äîand you should get to know these limitations BEFORE you attempt to move, visit, or contact your child or grandchild. Again, it is always best to follow a condition while appealing it rather than violate that condition. Speak to your parole agent or probation officer about your conditions so that you are clear where you can go and where you cannot go.</p>
