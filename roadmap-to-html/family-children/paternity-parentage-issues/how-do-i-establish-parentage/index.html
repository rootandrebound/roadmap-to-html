        <h1>How do I establish parentage?</h1>
        <p class="text">There are two main ways to establish paternity/parentage when the child’s parents are not married: </p>
        <ol class="text">Go to court and get a court order—either on your own or with the help of the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA). To begin, you should collect the forms you will need and file them in the county where your child lives (see <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm</a> for help on finding the right county.) Once you have found the right county, you can visit the steps below to guide you in filing your case. </ol>
        <ul class="textbox">For steps for filing a parentage case, go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11298.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11298.htm</a>.For instructions how to answer a request to establish parentage in court, go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11309.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11309.htm</a>. For forms and instruction to finish you parentage case go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11299.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11299.htm</a>.</ul>
        <ol class="text">Both parents sign a voluntary “Declaration of Paternity.” For more information on a Declaration of Paternity, see Appendix I, PG. 909. </ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc312427148"></a><a id="_Toc314389769"></a><a id="_Toc317247568"></a><a id="_Toc448153667"></a>Can i establish my parentage in court while i am incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes, you can establish paternity/parentage while you are incarcerated, but it will be difficult.</p>
        <p class="text">If you establish paternity/parentage through a court order, you are required to file the correct forms and “serve” them – give them formal notice - on the other party in the suit. You also have to make arrangements to either attend court hearings in person or through a videoconference. You can do all these things while you are incarcerated but it may not be easy:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Forms:</em></strong> We recommend you obtain assistance from one or all of the following:</p>
        <ol class="text">You can write to the Family Law Facilitator in the county where your child is currently living</ol>
        <ol class="text">Law clerks in the law library (if you have one in your institution)</ol>
        <ol class="text">Family and Friends – they can call the Family Law Facilitator for you or download the correct forms off the internet at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm</a> and send them to you. </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Filing fees:</em></strong> If you have limited funds, we recommend you try and obtain a file fee waiver from the court. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Attending court hearings:</em></strong> you can do one of the following:</p>
        <ol class="text">Request to be transported to court for the hearings. For more information on your right to be transported to court see PG. 818.</ol>
        <ol class="text">An alternative to your physically appearing in court is appearing by telephone or videoconference. We recommend that you ask for one of these options if transportation to court is not possible or feasible for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2385" id="footnote-ref-2385">[2385]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">If you establish paternity/parentage by signing a “Declaration of Paternity,” it must be signed by both parents at the same time and notarized. If you are incarcerated, this may not be possible. Another challenge is that the form is in triplicate and is only available through government offices such as county Social Services, Registrars of Births and Deaths, and Family Law Facilitators.<sup><a href="#footnote-2386" id="footnote-ref-2386">[2386]</a></sup> </p>

Examples include:Marriage of incest (where close blood relatives are married);Bigamous (where a person is already married or in a domestic partnerships with another.Other marriages that may be declared “void” may be based on:</ul><div class="widetablenumber8">Age at the time of the marriage (if a person was under 18 at the time)Prior existing marriages.A person was of “unsound mind”.

You may not need to hire a lawyer either.BUT REMEMBER: It is in your best interest to see a lawyer about how to end your marriage or domestic partnership.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><div class="titleheading">How do I get it?</div></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">You will have to file several forms, serve the forms,  Please see Appendix J for detailed information but here is a general overview of the steps:<br/>(1)Fill out court forms.  To file for divorce or legal separation, you have to fill out the same forms. If you want specific legal advice about how to fill out your court forms, talk to a lawyer.<br/>(2) File court forms/<br/>(3) Serve court forms on the other person (“party”).(4) Fill out and serve your financial disclosure forms. </ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">You will have to file several forms. See Appendix J on PG. 911 for the exact steps on how to do this. </ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">You will have to go in front of a judge and prove that one of the above reasons applies to you and your marriage or domestic partnership. Annulments are extremely rare! Be sure to talk to a lawyer BEFORE you go before a judge so you can talk to someone about whether this is best for you. For steps on getting an annulment, see Appendix J on PG. 911 for more information. </ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">If you are MARRIED, you must qualify for a summary dissolution. To find out if you qualify and the steps you must take, see Appendix J on PG. 911.

READ THESE PAPERS CAREFULLY!If you agree with everything—including how to separate property and arrange for custody or visitation of your child(ren)—your situation is considered “uncontested.”If you or your partner DO NOT agree with everything, your situation is considered “contested” and you may want to consider <em>mediation</em>. For more information on mediation, see PG. 882. In a contested matter, you can also ask for a separate trial to discuss the things you disagree about. Trials can be complicated; find more information in Appendix J on PG. 911.</ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">If your partner filed first, you must make sure you read the Petition (Form FL-100) VERY CAREFULLY. This form, along with The Summons (Form FL 110), tells you your rights and what to do. It may also include information on restraining orders and what you can or cannot do without the court’s consent. </ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">Read all the papers you receive which should include a petition (Form FL-100), and Summons (Form FL-110) CAREFULLY.And most importantly, Talk to a lawyer IMMEDIATELY! The law that applies to getting an annulment is very complicated and no website can explain it fully. </ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">If you and your partner are getting a summary dissolution, then both of you would know because one of the requirements is that both you AND your partner agree. If you cannot find your partner, or you or your partner do not want to get a divorce, you cannot get a summary dissolution. However you may be able to get a divorce. Follow the steps on how to get a divorce on Appendix J on PG. 911. </ul></td></tr><tr><td><div class="titleheading">What else could help me in legally ending my relationship?</div></td><td colspan="4"><ul class="learn-bullets">Whether you are seeking a divorce, annulment, legal separation or summary dissolution, you may want to look into mediation to help you and your partner come to agreements in the process.
