        <h1>How do I establish parentage?</h1>
        <p class="text">There are two main ways to establish paternity/parentage when the child‚Äôs parents are not married: </p>
        <ol class="text">Go to court and get a court order‚Äîeither on your own or with the help of the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA). To begin, you should collect the forms you will need and file them in the county where your child lives (see <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm</a> for help on finding the right county.) Once you have found the right county, you can visit the steps below to guide you in filing your case. </ol>
        <ol class="text">For steps for filing a parentage case, go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11298.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11298.htm</a>.</ol>
        <ol class="text">For instructions how to answer a request to establish parentage in court, go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11309.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11309.htm</a>. </ol>
        <ol class="text">For forms and instruction to finish you parentage case go to: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/11299.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/11299.htm</a>.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Both parents sign a voluntary ‚ÄúDeclaration of Paternity.‚Äù For more information on a Declaration of Paternity, see Appendix¬†J, PG.¬†812. </ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc312427148"></a><a id="_Toc314389769"></a><a id="_Toc317247568"></a><a id="_Toc352861936"></a>Can i establish my parentage in court while i am incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes, you can establish paternity/parentage while you are incarcerated, but it will be difficult.</p>
        <p class="text">If you establish paternity/parentage through a court order, you are required to file the correct forms and ‚Äúserve‚Äù them ‚Äì give them formal notice - on the other party in the suit. You also have to make arrangements to either attend court hearings in person or through a videoconference. You can do all these things while you are incarcerated but it may not be easy:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Forms:</em></strong> We recommend you obtain assistance from one or all of the following:</p>
        <ol class="text">You can write to the Family Law Facilitator in the county where your child is currently living</ol>
        <ol class="text">Law clerks in the law library (if you have one in your institution)</ol>
        <ol class="text">Family and Friends ‚Äì they can call the Family Law Facilitator for you or download the correct forms off the internet at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm</a> and send them to you. </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Filing fees:</em></strong> If you have limited funds, we recommend you try and obtain a file fee waiver from the court. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Attending court hearings:</em></strong> you can do one of the following:</p>
        <ol class="text">Request to be transported to court for the hearings. For more information on your right to be transported to court see PG.¬†735.</ol>
        <ol class="text">An alternative to your physically appearing in court is appearing by telephone or videoconference. We recommend that you ask for one of these options if transportation to court is not possible or feasible for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2496" id="footnote-ref-2496">[2495]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">If you establish paternity/parentage by signing a ‚ÄúDeclaration of Paternity,‚Äù it must be signed by both parents at the same time and notarized. If you are incarcerated, this may not be possible. Another challenge is that the form is in triplicate and is only available through government offices such as county Social Services, Registrars of Births and Deaths, and Family Law Facilitators.<sup><a href="#footnote-2497" id="footnote-ref-2497">[2496]</a></sup> </p>
