        <h1>How can I correct errors in my background check/ tenant report?</h1>
        <p class="text">The law that covers background checks and background check companies is very specific about how you can challenge mistaken, incomplete, or missing information in your background check report/tenant report. If you think there is something wrong, you can tell the landlord, call the background check company that ran the report, and try to get it fixed. For more details on how to correct mistakes in your background check report, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 915.</p>
