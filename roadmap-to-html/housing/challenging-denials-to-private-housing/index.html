        <h1>Challenging Denials to Private Housing:</h1>
        <p class="text">If you believe you have been illegally discriminated against in applying for private housing from a private landlord, you can challenge that discriminatory denial. Read about the bases that you can challenge an illegal discriminatory denial below, and which government agencies you should contact.</p>

            <ol class="text">Blanket bans against all people with criminal records</ol>
            <ol class="text">Treating your criminal record differently than others (arbitrary discrimination)</ol>
            <ol class="text">Landlord violated your right to notice of a background check, and your right to fix errors (go to PG. 372)</ol>
            <p class="text">Go to Appendix I, PG. 425 to learn about how to file a discrimination complaint with a government agency. Try to get a lawyer to help if you can. See PG. 1075 of this guide for a list of legal aid providers across California.</p>
            <p class="text">As a summary, your main options for challenging an illegal denial from private housing are the following:</p>
            <ol class="text">You could file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You could file an administrative complaint with HUD (the federal housing protection agency);</ol>
            <ol class="text">You could file a civil lawsuit in state or federal court; OR</ol>
            <ol class="text">You could allow HUD (the federal housing agency) or California’s DFEH (the state housing agency) to file a lawsuit on your behalf.</ol>
            <h3><a id="_Toc352861476"></a>How do I figure out which option to choose if I want to challenge a denial from private housing? </h3>
            <p class="text">Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with <em>both</em> HUD &amp; DFEH, but talking to a lawyer is important. More on each of these 3 options below.</p>
            <p class="text">For general instructions on how to file a complaint against a private landlord, go to Appendix I, PG. 425.</p>
