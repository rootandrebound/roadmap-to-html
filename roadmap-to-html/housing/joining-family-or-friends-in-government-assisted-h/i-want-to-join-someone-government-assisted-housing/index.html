        <h1>I want to join someone government-assisted housing. Can I?</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>It depends on your background and on the policies of the PHA or owner. T</em>he same eligibility and exclusion rules apply if you want to <em>join a family living in government-assisted housing </em>as those that would apply if you were applying on your own‚Äîsee PG.¬†352. As with new applicants there are a few limited situations<em> </em>in which a PHA or owner <em>must</em> reject the new family member<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1309" id="footnote-ref-1309">[1308]</a></sup></sup></span> (see PG.¬†356 for bans based on your criminal record). But in the vast majority of situations, the PHA or owner has <em>BROAD DISCRETION</em> to accept or reject you as an additional household member, just like for new applicants. </p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">FIRST, LEARN ABOUT THE CRIMINAL BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING.</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Return to the section above about bans to understand when there are <em>required bans</em> vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing <em>has discretion</em> (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG.¬†359 of this Chapter.</p>
        <p class="text">The rules for adding family members to an assisted household are different for every assisted housing program and are determined locally. You should be able to find these rules FOR YOUR PROGRAM. You can look in the following places:</p>
        <ol class="text">The PHA‚Äôs Annual Plan</ol>
        <ol class="text">The PHA‚Äôs Admission and Occupancy Plan (ACOP)</ol>
        <ol class="text">The lease for public housing</ol>
        <ol class="text">The Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Voucher program</ol>
        <ol class="text">The lease and/or house rules for all other government-assisted programs<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1310" id="footnote-ref-1310">[1309]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">The PHA‚Äôs website for these plans</ol>
        <ol class="text">By asking the PHA and/or owner for a copy.</ol>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Depending on the type of criminal activity and whether or not if happened on the government-assisted property, it could disqualify not just you, but your entire family from meeting the eligibility requirements of the assisted housing program! (Again, read PG.¬†351 to better understand eligibility requirements.)</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL RULE FOR SECTION 8 VOUCHERS: </h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The PHA is actually required to have a written policy in its ‚ÄúAdministrative Plan‚Äù about temporary absences for anyone in the ‚ÄúSection 8‚Äù Housing Choice Voucher program, so if you are in that program, there will definitely be a local policy! <br/>24 C.F.R. ¬ß¬†982.54(d)(10). The Voucher program‚Äôs temporary absence policy must state whether or when the family may be absent‚Äîincluding for imprisonment; the amount of time you are allowed to be absent for; and how to resume your housing assistance. <br/>24 C.F.R. ¬ß¬†982.312(e).</p>
        <h5 class="question"><a id="Report_joining_assisted_household"></a>Does the family in that household have to report the addition to the home? </h5>
        <p class="text">Yes. In general, if a family is adding an adult member to the household, they must (1)¬†tell the PHA and landlord AND (2) in most cases, receive the PHA‚Äôs and owner‚Äôs approval to add someone new.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1311" id="footnote-ref-1311">[1310]</a></sup></sup></span> Ask the PHA and owner what the rules are for reporting a new household member, and ask when you have to report the change. Follow the rules so your family member doesn‚Äôt risk losing their housing!</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861457"></a><a id="Rejoin_assist_household"></a>I want to go back to my government-assisted housing unit after a brief period in jail or prison. Can I do that? </h3>
        <p class="text">It depends on the program. And it depends on the criminal activity.</p>
        <p class="text">As always, anyone joining or returning to government-assisted housing MUST meet ALL of the eligibility requirements for that housing program, for that PHA, and for the owner (if there is one). </p>
        <p class="text">For exclusions (bans) based on your criminal record, read PG.¬†356 of this chapter to understand when there are <em>required bans</em> vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing <em>has discretion</em> (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG.¬†359 of this Chapter.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>For most federal government-assisted housing programs</em>, the local PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may develop rules and policies regarding temporary absences, and many do have such policies. You need to check with the PHA and owner that oversee the housing unit you want to join about their policies.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1312" id="footnote-ref-1312">[1311]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Since your return could harm the entire family‚Äôs ability to stay in government-assisted housing, it‚Äôs a good idea for the family to discuss these issues with the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing BEFORE you return from your brief absence. If that is not possible, there are legal defenses to an eviction action if it is brought against the entire family in court. This HOUSING CHAPTER does not cover eviction law and all of its defenses, so if this is your issue, you will need to contact a legal aid organization that specializes in eviction defense. Go to PG.¬†1075 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help.</p>
        <li id="footnote-1309"><p> See PG.¬†391 for a discussion of the screening criteria relating to individuals with criminal histories. <a href="#footnote-ref-1309">‚Üë</a></p></li>

        <li id="footnote-1311"><p> 24 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß¬†966.4(a)(1)(v), 982.516(c), 982.551(h)(2). Because tenants generally are not aware of the rules set forth in HUD Handbooks, and the lease does not require interim reporting, tenants without notice of the obligation to report should not be penalized for failing to report interim changes in family composition. Compare HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs ¬∂¬†7-10(A)(2) (rev. November 2013) (requiring that all tenants notify the owner when a family member proposes to move a new member into the unit), with HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, App. 4-A the model lease, ¬∂¬†16a (does not require interim reporting of changes in family composition). <a href="#footnote-ref-1311">‚Üë</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-1312"><p> In the RD programs, the owner must include a number of policies in the lease with the tenant, which must be approved by the agency. RD regulations require that the lease include information regarding the tenant‚Äôs duty to notify the owner of an extended absence. 7 C.F.R. ¬ß¬†3560.156(c)(18)(xiii). <a href="#footnote-ref-1312">‚Üë</a></p></li>
