          <h2><a href="/housing/joining-family-or-friends-in-government-assisted-h/policies-for-live-in-aides-in-government-assisted-/what-is-a-live-in-aide/">What is a “live-in aide?”</a></h2>
            <p class="text">A live-in aide is a person who <em>resides with</em> one or more elderly, near elderly, or disabled persons, and who is <em>essential to the care</em> and well-being of that individual. The live-in aide is not obligated to support the person and would not be living in the unit except to provide the required services.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1326" id="footnote-ref-1326">[1325]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
            <p class="text">A live-in aide is NOT a household member. If you are a live-in aide, your income will be <em>excluded</em> from calculating the rent for the assisted unit. However, the family that lives in the unit could request an extra bedroom for the live-in aide and then be required to pay the standard amount for the larger bedroom size.</p>

            <p class="text">Maybe. If you have a criminal record, you may be able to reside in a government-assisted housing unit as a <em>live-in aide</em>, but you will need to be screened (see next question).</p>
            <p class="text">Depending on the policies of the PHA or owner, the criminal background check conducted for a live-in aide may be less strict than the one used for admitting a new tenant because a live-in aide is <em>not</em> considered a true household member.</p>

            <p class="text">Yes. The PHA and owner can screen you for issues related to your being present in the assisted unit. Most PHAs and owners will screen live-in aides for their criminal background <em>using the same or similar criteria</em> as they use for admissions (read PG. 356 for the criminal record-related bans in federal government-housing, including which ones are <em>required</em> versus which ones are <em>allowed</em>).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1327" id="footnote-ref-1327">[1326]</a></sup></sup></span></p>

            <p class="text">No. The <em>PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. </em>Your credit history has nothing to do with the family’s ability to pay for the unit—so you should not be screened for credit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1328" id="footnote-ref-1328">[1327]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <h3><a id="_Toc352861470"></a>I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do? </h3>
            <p class="text"><em>The </em><strong><em>person requiring aide</em></strong> should ask for a <strong><em>review hearing</em></strong>. Go to PG. 359 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide. There may be situations in which the disabled or elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a <em>reasonable accommodation</em> for a disability by asking the PHA or owner <em>to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant’s life</em>. </p>

            <p class="text">Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is successful will depend upon the facts and an interpretation of reasonable accommodation rules, discussed in Appendix E, PG. 414.</p>
