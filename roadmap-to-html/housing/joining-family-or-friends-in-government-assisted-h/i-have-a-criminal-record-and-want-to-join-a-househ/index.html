        <h1>I have a criminal record and want to join a household living in federal government-assisted housing. Can I?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on your conviction and the requirements of the government-assisted housing program.</p>
        <p class="text">There is a good chance you will want to join or rejoin a family living in a government-assisted housing unit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1308" id="footnote-ref-1308">[1307]</a></sup></sup></span> Unfortunately, the laws and policies for adding an individual with a criminal record to an existing household can be complex, and sometimes the interests of other family members who are living in the government-assisted housing unit will conflict with your interests in joining them.</p>
        <p class="text">Here are some COMMON QUESTIONS that often come up, which we will address in this section.</p>
        <ol class="text">May I join my family members in their government-assisted housing unit? (PG. 380)</ol>
        <ol class="text">Does my family have to tell the PHA or owner that I am joining their assisted household? How do they do that? (PG. 381)</ol>
        <ol class="text">Can we challenge a denial if the PHA or owner rejects my application to join the household? How do we do that? (PG. 359) </ol>
        <ol class="text">Do I have any rights if I am rejoining my household in government-assisted housing? (PG. 381)</ol>
        <ol class="text">What are the rules if I just want to be a guest of someone living in government-assisted housing and I have a record? (PG. 383)</ol>
        <ol class="text">What are the rules if I am a live-in aide for someone living in government-assisted housing and I have a record? (PG. 385)</ol>
        <li id="footnote-1308"><p> Studies have shown that a substantial number of public housing residents have family members or significant others with recent criminal history. See Catrina Gouvis Roman, Taking Stock: Housing, Homelessness, And Prison Reentry 24 (2004). It’s likely that members of other federally assisted housing programs are similar. <a href="#footnote-ref-1308">↑</a></p></li>
