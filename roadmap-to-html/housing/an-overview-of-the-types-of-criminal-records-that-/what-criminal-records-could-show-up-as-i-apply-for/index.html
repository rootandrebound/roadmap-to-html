        <h1>What criminal records could show up as I apply for any type of housing?</h1>
        <p class="text">Here are three major categories of records that might tell a private landlord, Public Housing Authority (PHA), or owner of government-assisted housing something about your criminal history:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">LEARN ABOUT WHEN YOUR Criminal RECORDS CAN BE ACCESSED</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">We go into the rules about when these records can be accessed, and what can be considered, beginning on PG. 372.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>1) CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">These include: government-produced criminal records; publicly available court records of cases involving you; police and law enforcement records including arrest records; reports produced by private background check and tenant-screening companies (see #2: “BACKGROUND CHECKS/TENANT REPORTS” below); Internet research; the newspaper; and/or information received directly from you—through an application form or by asking you. Learn more about where your criminal records come from in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 915.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>2) BACKGROUND CHECKS/“TENANT REPORTS”:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">A private landlord, PHA, or government-assisted owner will MOST LIKELY get a copy of your background check from a private company—and when it’s for a housing provider, the background check report is often called a “tenant report.” Tenant reports show <em>credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries in sex offender registries or other public databases, driving records, interviews with people who know you, and more</em>. These reports are created and provided by private background check companies and/or credit bureaus. (See PG. 372 to better understand the rules about getting background checks, and what information can be considered for housing.)</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>3) DRUG OR ALCOHOL TREATMENT RECORDS:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">These are documents that show your enrollment in, participation in, and completion of any drug or alcohol treatment programs. In some cases, a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing, <em>may</em> be able to get records about your past drug or alcohol treatment, BUT A REGULAR PRIVATE LANDLORD CANNOT GET THESE RECORDS.<sup><a href="#footnote-1262" id="footnote-ref-1262">[1261]</a></sup> </p>
        <li id="footnote-1262"><p> For more reading on this topic, see Sharon M Dietrich, When “Your Permanent Record” is a Permanent Barrier: Helping Legal Aid Clients Reduce the Stigma of Criminal Records, 41 Clearinghouse Rev. 139, 141 (July-Aug. 2007), discussing what applicants can do to improve or challenge the criminal record. <a href="#footnote-ref-1262">↑</a></p></li>
