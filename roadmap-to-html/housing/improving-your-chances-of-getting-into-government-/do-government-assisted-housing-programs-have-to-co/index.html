        <h1>Do government-assisted housing programs have to consider mitigating circumstances & evidence of rehabilitation?</h1>
        <p class="text">Generally, programs are not required to consider mitigating circumstances and evidence of rehabilitation,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1257" id="footnote-ref-1257">[1256]</a></sup></sup> but they are encouraged to do so.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1258" id="footnote-ref-1258">[1257]</a></sup></sup></span> Only the Public Housing program—run by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—MUST consider mitigating circumstances (that is in cases where the PHA has a criminal record ban in place that is not required by law—see PG. 354 for more information on such bans that are <em>allowed</em>, but not required).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1259" id="footnote-ref-1259">[1258]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">Good news! THIS GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND PRESENT FACTS IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT YOUR RECORD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT—WHICH WILL IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING ACCEPTED.</p>
        <p class="text">All PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are ENCOURAGED to look at the following (and for the Public Housing program, PHAs <em>must</em> look at the following):<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1260" id="footnote-ref-1260">[1259]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Every application for housing on a case-by-case basis;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The seriousness of the offense;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The time that has passed since the offense;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The effect that denial of admission would have on the rest of your family;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The effect that denial of admission would have on the community;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The extent to which you have taken responsibility for your actions and taken steps to prevent or mitigate bad conduct in the future;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Evidence of rehabilitation;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Mitigating circumstances relating to your disability or the disability of any family member; <em>and</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">Evidence of your family’s participation or willingness to participate in social services, reentry support, or counseling programs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1261" id="footnote-ref-1261">[1260]</a></sup></sup></ol>

Supp. 134, 138 (M.D. Pa. 1979), aff’d mem., 620 F.2d 288 (3d Cir. 1980) (applicant has burden of putting forth such evidence).In court cases involving eviction or termination of benefits through the government-assisted housing program, courts have sent cases back for review because of the PHA or landlord’s failure to consider mitigating circumstances. See Hicks v. Dakota Cnty. Comm. Dev. Agency, No. A06-1302, 2007 WL2416872 (Minn. App., Aug. 28, 2007) (“The permissive nature of the [voucher] regulation does not preclude a determination that mitigating circumstances are an important factor that must be considered in a particular case.”); Oakwood Plaza Apartments v. Smith, 352 N.J.
