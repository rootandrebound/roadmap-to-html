        <h1>How long does the eviction process take?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you do not file an “Answer” to the eviction notice, the sheriff may be out to evict you as soon as 11 days after you receive the <em>Summons</em> and <em>Complaint</em>. If you file an Answer to the lawsuit, the process will take a little longer. Do not expect the entire process to take more than 1 month—it could take even less than 1 month. Contrary to some popular belief, you can be evicted if even if you are pregnant, have small children, have an unexpected financial hardship (like losing your job), if you’ve never been late with the rent before or if you have nowhere else to move.</p>
