        <h1>The 3-Day Notice to Quit</h1>
        <p class="text">This kind of notice orders you to move because you have done something that the landlord believes cannot be corrected. This is the most serious notice your landlord can give you. For example, you may get this kind of notice if you have done illegal things (such as using or dealing drugs) on the property. This notice does not give you the chance to correct what was done. This notice means your landlord just wants you to move out. This notice must be in writing.</p>
        <p class="text">If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of doing something that you did not do, you should write to your landlord immediately and state that you did not do what you are accused of doing. Make sure you date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. You must also keep a copy of the letter for your records.</p>
        <p class="text">If you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, as with other eviction notices, after the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply kick you out without a court order.</p>
