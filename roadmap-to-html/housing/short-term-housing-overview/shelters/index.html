        <h1>Shelters</h1>
        <p class="text">Most shelters are free, and usually offer a bed and shower for one night or multiple nights, and sometimes services such as counseling and job-search assistance. While transitional and permanent housing options can take time to arrange, you can usually access a shelter immediately. Here are some of the main types of shelters that exist:</p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>24-hour Shelters</strong>—24-hour shelters let you to stay at night and during the day and participate in the services the shelter offers (for example: meals, counseling, and job training, just to name a few). Don’t let the name mislead you—a 24-hour shelter doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave after 24 hours: in the Bay Area, for example, many 24-hour shelters have beds available for up to 30-90 days; and other shelters reserve beds for people who are participating in special programs, like a required work-program. The key is that 24-hour shelters are open day and night. Ask the specific shelter you’re interested in about any other requirements or restrictions it has.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>12-hour Shelters</strong>—12-hour shelters let you stay for a 12-hour period overnight (usually 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), but require you to leave in the morning.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Day Shelters</strong> let you come and take advantage of their services during the day, but you can’t stay overnight. Services at day shelters may include showers, meals, computer access, and optional programs like case management/support services and counseling sessions.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Family Shelters</strong> have places to stay for you and the rest of your family. They tend to be 24-hour shelters (see the first type of shelter listed above).</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Domestic Violence Shelters</strong> take women (usually not men) who are trying to find safety from someone who is abusive. They usually have confidential addresses for the safety of the residents. Many domestic violence shelters also allow women to bring their children with them.</ol>
        <h3 class="subheading2"> <a id="Transitional_housing"></a><a id="_Toc352861352"></a>Transitional housing programs</h3>
        <p class="text">Transitional housing programs are temporary programs that offer housing and services. Keep in mind they usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. </p>
        <p class="text">Examples of transitional housing programs include:<em> </em>shared or private apartments, residential programs that allow for temporary stays (from 3 months to 2 years) at no cost or at a low cost, and sober living environments (SLE) (read more about SLEs on PG. 347). Some transitional housing programs also have services like job training, counseling, general education development (“GED”) programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are for people with specific needs such as mental health support, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 347), or safety from domestic violence (see PG. 344). </p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">How CAN I show Proof of homelessness</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">For proof of homelessness, most housing providers will just need a signed statement. If the housing provider asks for further documentation, you may need to show eviction papers, a letter from a social worker, etc. Some organizations will also issue certificates of homelessness, for example:Coalition on Homelessness<br/>488 Turk Street<br/>San Francisco, CA 94102<br/>Phone: (415) 346-3740<br/><em>Certificates of Homelessness are issued Mondays and Wednesdays 10 a.m.–12 p.m.</em></p>

          <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/housing/short-term-housing-overview/shelters/can-i-get-into-a-transitional-housing-program-if-i/">Can I get into a transitional housing program if I am still incarcerated?</a></h2>
            <p class="text"><em>It depends on the program. </em>Unfortunately, most post-release transitional housing programs will not let you fill out an application or get on the waitlist before your release. A few let you apply from inside prison or jail, but may have other requirements or restrictions. Go to Appendix B on PG. 404 for a partial list of transitional housing options in California that <em>may</em> accept residents who write to them from inside prison or jail.</p>
            <p class="text">BUT NOTE: In recent years, the CDCR has introduced several pre-release transitional housing programs designed to let people to carry out the last part of their sentence in a controlled community setting.These are <em>alternatives</em> to traditional incarceration that typically provide for greater freedom. Participants remain under the CDCR’s jurisdiction and control and are NOT on parole or other post-release supervision. In that sense, these programs are very different from the posts-release housing options discussed here. For more information on CDCR-sponsored pre-release programs see PG. 341.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>It depends</em>—each program has different requirements. You might need: identification (learn how to get different types of identification in the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING, beginning on PG. 21); proof of homelessness; proof of any income; proof of your sobriety; police clearance; to get through the waitlist; to have an interview; etc. It’s best to CALL (or if you’re currently incarcerated, ask a family member or friend to call, or WRITE the program a letter with your request) to find out well in advance of when you want to move exactly what you need to do and what the requirements are!</p>
