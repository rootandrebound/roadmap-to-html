        <p class="textbox"><strong>Summary</strong>: Enables men to complete their sentences in a residential setting, with greater freedom and privileges. Programming is particularly (though not exclusively) geared towards people with both mental health and substance abuse issues. <strong>Program Timeframe</strong>: Participants must have <strong>30 to 180 days</strong> left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means you should begin asking your counselor about the program as you approach your final 180 days. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.<strong>Supervision</strong>: On-site correctional staff and employees from the contracted facilities (listed below) supervise program participants 24 hours a day. Participants must also wear ankle monitors.<strong>Locations</strong>: Oroville (Butte County), Bakersfield (Kern County), and Los Angeles, CA (Los Angeles County).<strong>Contacts</strong>:Butte County:		Jody Alsdurf, (530) 533-5272Tri County Treatment2740 Oro Dam BlvdOroville, CA 95966Kern County: 		Jaime Contreras, (661) 861-6111, ex. 43Turning Point of Central California1100 Union Ave.Bakersfield, CA 93307Los Angeles County: 	Michael Brenner, (213) 251-2830HealthRight3602307 West 6th StreetLos Angeles, CA 90057</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Am I eligible for the Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP)?</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">The MCRP accepts people with all levels of offenses from any institution in the state, so long as you have approximately <strong>30 to 180 days</strong> left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. To qualify for the program, your <strong>county of last legal residence</strong> must have been Butte County, Kern County, Los Angeles County, or San Diego County. If your county of last legal residence is elsewhere, you may still be able to participate in the MCRP if you <strong>transfer supervision</strong> to one of the four counties listed. </p>
        <p class="text">Certain people are <strong><em>automatically</em> ineligible</strong> for the MCRP. If you meet any of the following criteria, you will not be considered for the program:</p>
        <ol class="text">You are listed on the sex offender registry pursuant to Penal Code section 290, are classified with an R-suffix denoting a past sexual offense, or have been convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined in Health and Safety Code section 6600.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a Static Risk Assessment score of five or higher, which means the CDCR has predicted that you are likely to commit a violent offense upon release. This is calculated based on your age, gender, prior convictions, and rules violations.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have attempted to escape in the past five years</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have active or potential felony holds, warrants, or detainers</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have spent time in the Security Housing Unit or Psychiatric Security Unit within the last year</ol>
        <ol class="text">You are classified as part of Security Threat Group I</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have engaged in A through C-class misconduct within the last year of being in custody. In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, batter, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP. </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>How do I apply for the MCRP? </em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">The MCRP is a <strong>voluntary</strong> program, so you must initiate the application process yourself by letting your counselor know you are interested. The application process has three components, all of which your counselor will provide: the application itself, a contract agreeing to certain terms, and mandatory assessments. The assessments use information about your personal background to determine which programs and services will best aid your reentry to society. This includes your history of substance abuse, medical and mental health, education, family background, criminal history, and social functioning.</p>
        <p class="text">Once you have completed these requirements, your application will go through a rigorous screening process lasting anywhere from 30 to 60 days. Medical staff, the warden, and a classification committee will all review your application and provide their input. If you are eligible, the committee may endorse you for placement. The committee makes decisions about placement on a case-by-case basis. </p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program (CCTRP)**</strong></ol>
        <p class="text">**Sometimes referred to as the “Enhanced Alternative to Custody Program”</p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>Summary</strong>: Enables <strong>women</strong> to complete their sentences in a residential setting. Services are designed to prevent recidivism by addressing unique challenges women face upon reentry, such as gender-based trauma and mother-child relationships. From early morning until evening, participants partake in special activities and workshops, with some free time available. They may seek outside employment upon approval from the CCTRP staff, but a portion of earnings are held by the program until release.  <strong>Program Timeframe</strong>: Participants must have <strong>45 days to two years</strong> left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means you should start asking your counselors about the program as you approach the last two years of your sentence. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.<strong>Supervision</strong>: On-site correctional staff and contracted employees from the WestCare Foundation supervise program participants 24 hours a day. Participants must also wear ankle monitors.<strong>Locations</strong>: San Diego (San Diego County), Santa Fe Springs (Los Angeles County), Bakersfield (Kern County), Stockton (San Joaquin County).<strong>Contact</strong>: San Diego:                   (619) 359-8266                                    Westcare                                    3050 Armstrong Street                                    San Diego, CA 92117Santa Fe Springs:         (562) 236-9390                                    Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse                                    11121 Bloomfield Ave.                                    Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670Bakersfield:                  (661) 447-4666                                     Casa Aurora                                    1932 Jessie Street                                    Bakersfield, CA 93305Stockton:                      (209) 642-8488                                     Westcare                                    1609 N.

        <p class="text"><strong><em>Am I eligible for the Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program (CCTRP)?</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">In order to qualify for the program, you must be housed at a women’s prison. In addition, the program requires that you have (1) a conviction for a serious or violent crime AND (2) 45 days to two years left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>How do I apply for the CCTRP? </em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">To apply, you must volunteer to join the program. Your counselor can provide you with an application once you express interest. CDCR staff has the discretion to accept or deny applicants as it sees fit. In making this determination, CDCR staff will consider your institutional history and behavior. In particular, they will look into whether you have taken advantage of institutional program and shown a strong commitment to self-improvement.</p>

A CPMP Coordinator facilitates the application procedure at each of the women’s prisons, and should provide you with an application form, which you must fill out and submit to CDCR staff. The CDCR staff then determines eligibility by looking at the nature of your crime, whether you have a history of violence, and your physical, mental, and dental health. According to a 2010 investigation by Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, this process takes anywhere from a few months to over a year</p>

        <p><strong>Am I eligible for the Alternative Custody Program (ACP)?</strong></p>
        <p class="text">In order to qualify for the program, you must have 45 days to two years left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. CDCR staff has the discretion to accept or deny applicants as it sees fit. Certain people are <strong>automatically ineligible</strong> for the ACP. If you meet any of the following criteria, you will not be considered for the program:</p>
        <ol class="text">You were convicted of a violent felony as defined in Penal Code section 667.5(c) (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, and any robbery).</ol>
        <ol class="text">You were convicted of a serious felony as defined in Penal Code section 1192.7. (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, kidnapping, and certain assault crimes).</ol>
        <ol class="text">You are listed on the sex offender registry pursuant to Penal Code section 290 or have been convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined in Health and Safety Code section 6600.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a Static Risk Assessment score of five or higher, which means the CDCR has predicted you are likely to commit a violent offense upon release. This is calculated based on your age, gender, prior convictions, and rules violations.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have attempted to escape a penal institution in the past five years.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have active or potential felony holds, warrants, or detainers.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Someone has filed an active restraining order against you.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have spent time in the Security Housing Unit or Psychiatric Security Unit within the last year.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a history of associated with gangs while in custody.</ol>
        <ol class="text">The Board of Parole Hearings has found that you violated a condition of parole by committing a serious or violent offense or absconding within the past two years.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have engaged in A through C-class misconduct within the last year of being in custody. In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, battery, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You meet other, undefined exclusionary criteria, which potentially includes a current medical or psychiatric diagnosis, a history of perpetrating child abuse, and the inability to find an appropriate placement site. In such cases, CDCR staff will decide to exclude on a case-by-case basis. </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>How do I apply for the ACP? </em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">First, you need to obtain an acceptance letter from an existing transitional housing facility. Once you have received this letter, you may ask your counselor for an ACP application. When you fill out this application, list the facility that has accepted you as your chosen site. The CDCR must approve of the site. </p>
        <p class="text">Once you are determined to be eligible for the ACP, a CDCR staff member will respond within two weeks to notify you that your eligibility has been approved. Staff will then help you develop an individualized treatment and rehabilitation plan, to be used if you are accepted into the program.  </p>
        <p class="text">Lastly, you will receive a written notice explaining whether your application was accepted or denied. If your application is accepted, you will be released no later than seven business days after receiving written notice. If there are no free beds at your requested facility, you will be released the first day a bed becomes available. </p>
        <p class="text">If your application is denied, the written notice will explain the reasons for denial. You may appeal the denial through normal grievance procedures, or can reapply 30 days after receiving written notice.</p>

        <p class="text">Under the law, housing providers cannot treat persons with disabilities exactly the same as other housing applicants or residents if doing so denies people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1359" id="footnote-ref-1359">[1358]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, by law, a PHA or owner <em>must</em> make reasonable accommodations to its <em>rules, policies, practices, or services </em>when it may be necessary to provide applicants with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1360" id="footnote-ref-1360">[1359]</a></sup></sup>—<em>even if</em> that accommodation results in a preference for disabled individuals over similar, non-disabled individuals.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1361" id="footnote-ref-1361">[1360]</a></sup></sup><em> </em>This rule applies to ALL types of housing—public and private. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just because you committed a criminal offense as a result of a disability does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation for housing. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability CAUSED your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation</p>

There are no reported California cases where a rehabilitated applicant with a history of substance abuse, or an applicant with mental impairment, and a history of criminal acts arising from the substance abuse or mental illness has been granted a reasonable accommodation from a PHA’s criminal activity restrictions.

Specifically, courts have been hesitant to accept arguments that a housing applicant’s criminal convictions were the result of mental illness and/or past substance abuse. Again, since it may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction, it is important that you offer as much evidence as possible. </p>

        <ol class="text">If your disability is known and obvious, but your need for the accommodation is not well-known or obvious, then the housing provider should ask only for information necessary to verify the need for a reasonable accommodation—for example, notes explaining your need from a doctor or clinician. </ol>

        <ol class="text"><strong>The Decision</strong>. After reviewing your request, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will decide whether or not to grant your reasonable accommodation request. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>The “Interactive” process</strong>:</ol>
        <ol class="text">If the PHA, owner, or housing provider refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you should try to engage them in an informal “interactive process” in which you discuss alternative solutions that might meet both of your needs. HUD guidelines encourage you to try this informal route first, before starting the formal grievance procedure, because it is more flexible and often leads to quicker resolutions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1381" id="footnote-ref-1381">[1380]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">If after the “interactive process,” the PHA, owner, or housing provider still refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you may have to file a formal complaint with HUD or DFEH.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1382" id="footnote-ref-1382">[1381]</a></sup></sup> </ol>

        <p class="text"><strong>OPTION 1: YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT. </strong>If you believe that a PHA, owner, or housing provider denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you may file a complaint with HUD (federal housing protection agency) or with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1383" id="footnote-ref-1383">[1382]</a></sup></sup></span> After you file a complaint, if HUD or DFEH determines that you were discriminated against (they find your complaint has “merit”), then HUD or DFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the PHA, owner, or housing provider on your behalf.

        <p class="text">Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with <em>both</em> HUD &amp; DFEH. More on each of these 3 options below.</p>
        <p class="text">You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH or the federal agency HUD, or both. This may lead to a lawsuit in civil court (possible with both DFEH or HUD) or an administrative hearing (HUD only).

        <p class="text">You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH <em>within 1 year</em> of the discriminatory act.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1403" id="footnote-ref-1403">[1402]</a></sup></sup> To begin the process, you must contact DFEH in writing, online, or by phone, with basic information about the discrimination (what happened to you, when, where, etc.).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1404" id="footnote-ref-1404">[1403]</a></sup></sup> The DFEH will conduct an intake interview to learn more about your situation, and to determine whether you can file a formal (“<em>verified</em>”) complaint.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1405" id="footnote-ref-1405">[1404]</a></sup></sup> See PG. 425 for a step-by-step explanation of the DFEH’s state complaint process.</p>
        <h5 class="question">Under what circumstances will California’s DFEH accept my complaint?</h5>
        <p class="text">DFEH is supposed to be very generous in accepting your complaint. However, in some cases, the DFEH may decide that you cannot file a complaint—for example, if the landlord’s conduct is legal, happened more than a year ago, or is outside of DFEH’s legal control, or if you already filed a complaint with DFEH or HUD regarding the same discrimination.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1406" id="footnote-ref-1406">[1405]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
        <h5 class="question">How much time does the DFEH have to respond and investigate?</h5>
        <p class="text">Once the DFEH accepts your complaint, it must follow certain time limits. The DFEH has <em>10 days</em> to inform you of your procedural rights and obligations.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1407" id="footnote-ref-1407">[1406]</a></sup></sup></strong> The landlord then has <em>20 days</em> to respond to the complaint.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1408" id="footnote-ref-1408">[1407]</a></sup></sup></strong> Within <em>30 days</em>, DFEH must begin to investigate your complaint, and it must finish the investigation within <em>100 days</em>.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1409" id="footnote-ref-1409">[1408]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
        <h5 class="question">Will I have to do anything else while I wait for a response from the DFEH?</h5>
        <p class="text">Maybe.<em> </em>At some point (before, during, or after the investigation), the DFEH may also require you and the landlord to go through mediation (meaning an alternative dispute resolution or a settlement negotiation) to see whether you can resolve the problem cooperatively.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1410" id="footnote-ref-1410">[1409]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>

        <h4 class="step">File a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire.</h4>
        <p class="text">First, you need to file a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, Form DFEH-700-01 (English) or Form DFEH-700-01S (Spanish). A Pre-Complaint Questionnaire can be filed by you, the Director of DFEH, or a community organization. You can do this <em>online, by phone, or by mail. </em></p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is very important that you provide an up-to-date phone number where you can be reached!</p>

        <h4 class="step">Intake.</h4>
        <p class="text">Within<em> 10 days</em> of receiving your Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, an investigator from the DFEH will contact you by telephone to conduct an intake interview. The investigator will ask you questions to collect facts about the possible discrimination.</p>
        <h4 class="step">File the Formal Complaint.</h4>
        <p class="text">If your complaint is accepted for investigation, the DFEH investigator will draft the complaint and ask for you or your representative to sign the complaint. This formal complaint is then served on the “Respondent” (the person or entity that who you have made the allegation against). The Respondent is required to answer the complaint and is given the opportunity to voluntarily resolve it. A no-fault resolution can be negotiated at any time during the complaint process.</p>
        <p class="text">If there is also federal law that would protect you, then the formal complaint is also filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Note: HUD usually accepts DFEH’s findings with respect to the alleged discrimination.</p>
        <h4 class="step">Investigation Period.</h4>
        <p class="text">DFEH must investigate every case in a standard, timely manner.</p>
        <p class="text">DFEH has the authority to take depositions, issue subpoenas and interrogatories and seek Temporary Restraining Orders when appropriate.</p>
        <p class="text">If the investigative findings do not show a violation of the law, the DFEH will close the case. If the DFEH finds a violation, continue to STEP 5.</p>
        <h4 class="step"><a id="FEHA_mediation"></a>Mediation (a.k.a. “Conciliation”)</h4>
        <p class="text">If the DFEH’s investigation shows that there was a violation of fair housing law, then it will schedule formal mediation/ conciliation conferences between the DFEH’s representatives, you, and the responding landlord.</p>
        <p class="text">During the mediation/conciliation conference, the DFEH presents information supporting its belief that there has been a violation and explores options to resolve the complaint.</p>
        <p class="text">If formal mediation/conciliation fails, the DFEH will then have to decide whether or not to file a civil lawsuit.</p>
        <ol class="text">Possible Outcome #1: If the DFEH determines that you have been discriminated against (that your complaint has “merit”), and that the discrimination cannot be resolved through mediation, the DEFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the landlord on your behalf. (Continue to STEP 6 below).</ol>
        <ol class="text">Possible Outcome #2: If the DFEH decides not to file a lawsuit (or takes longer than <em>100 days</em> to file the lawsuit), the DFEH <em>must give you a written notice</em> with the following information: (1) DFEH’s decision regarding your complaint, (2) the reasons for the DFEH’s decision; (3) your right to sue the landlord directly in court (see PG. 429 below on how to file a civil lawsuit in court); and (3) a list resources for filing a civil lawsuit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1412" id="footnote-ref-1412">[1411]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <h4 class="step">Litigation</h4>
        <p class="text">If the DFEH decides to litigate the case, it will be heard in civil court. </p>
        <h4 class="step">Court Remedies &amp; Possible Outcomes.</h4>
        <p class="text">If the lawsuit is successful (meaning the court finds that the landlord discriminated against you), you may be awarded some or all of the following remedies: </p>
        <ol class="text"><em>actual money damages</em> (to compensate you for your losses); </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>punitive damages</em> (to punish the landlord for committing illegal discrimination); </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>injunctive relief</em> (ordering the landlord to stop discriminating or take some other action, such as changing its screening procedures or providing you with housing); AND/OR </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>attorneys fees and costs</em> (to reimburse the DFEH or a private attorney for the costs of the lawsuit).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1413" id="footnote-ref-1413">[1412]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">Below is a flowchart showing what happens when you file a DFEH complaint.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1414" id="footnote-ref-1414">[1413]</a></sup></sup> Remember: if HUD (the federal fair housing agency, see PG. 428) also has jurisdiction (legal authority) over your housing complaint, then the DFEH will also file your complaint with HUD at the same time.</p>

        <h5 class="question">How much time do I have to file a complaint after the discriminatory act occurs?</h5>

        <ol class="text"><strong><em>Special Case #2:</em></strong> If your complaint has to do with the legality or illegality of any <em>zoning or other land use law</em>, then HUD must refer it to the U.S. DOJ for civil prosecution.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1419" id="footnote-ref-1419">[1418]</a></sup></sup></strong></span> HUD must then file either a charge against the respondent, or dismiss the complaint.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1420" id="footnote-ref-1420">[1419]</a></sup></sup></strong></span></ol>

        <p class="text">It may! If your city or county has <em>special protections</em> against housing discrimination of people with records, <em>or has local agencies</em> in charge of enforcing fair housing laws, then you may also want to bring your housing discrimination complaint to the city agency responsible for fair housing where you live. If you aren’t sure, you can always ask someone at the DFEH, or ask a local nonprofit housing attorney (see a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to assist you on PG. 1075). For example, the city of San Francisco, CA has a new law called the “Fair Chance Ordinance” that adds additional protections for people with criminal records who apply to live in <em>city-funded affordable housing</em> (which includes Below Market Rate or “BMR” units in private buildings in SF). Go to Appendix H, PG. 422 for information on the San Francisco law and the process of filing a complaint against a landlord or housing provider who has violated the law in San Francisco.</p>

        <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppJ"></a>Rural development (RD) grievance procedures </div>
        <p class="text">The grievance procedures for Rural Development (RD) housing are different from most other government-assisted housing programs. Here is an overview of how it works if you live in RD housing:</p>
        <ol class="text">When a grievance is filed, regulations require the owner of the multifamily property (or owner’s representative) to offer to meet informally with the denied applicant within 10 calendar days to resolve the grievance. </ol>
        <ol class="text">If the informal meeting fails to resolve the issue, the owner must file a report summarizing the problem to USDA (DEFINE THIS) and the applicant.</ol>
        <ol class="text">The applicant (you) may submit a summary of the problem to USDA. </ol>
        <ol class="text">After you get a summary of the problem, you must file a written request for an informal review hearing within 10 calendar days.</ol>
        <ol class="text">After you request the informal review hearing, a hearing panel will be selected.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You and the owner of the multifamily property may agree on a hearing officer, <em>or</em> you may each appoint one member of a 3-person panel, and those two hearing officers choose the third officer. If you and the owner <em>cannot agree within 30 days </em>on the two hearing officers, USDA will give you notice and appoint a person to act as the sole hearing officer.</ol>
        <ol class="text">A USDA-approved ‘Standing Hearing Panel’ can also hear all grievances related to a particular development, where at least one member of the standing hearing panel must be selected by the residents at a formal resident meeting called to select hearing panel members.</ol>
        <ol class="text">After the hearing panel is selected, the hearing will be scheduled within 15 days.</ol>

        <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppK"></a>Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)</div>
        <p class="text">It’s very common to live in transitional housing after release from prison or jail. As described on PG. 340, transitional housing programs are <em>temporary</em> programs that offer <em>temporary</em> housing and services. They usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Some transitional housing programs offer services like job training, counseling, GED programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are intended for people with specific needs such as mental illness, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 347), disabilities (PG. 414), or domestic violence support (see PG. 344).</p>
        <p class="text">In this section, we explain a special law called the Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA). Just because you live in transitional housing does NOT mean that the THPMA applies to you, <strong><em>so read carefully</em></strong><em>!</em></p>
        <div class="questionheading">HOW CAN A transitional HOUSING PROVIDER REMOVE ME FROM MY HOUSING?</div>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>AS A </em></strong><a id="Formal_eviction_general_rule"></a><strong><em>GENERAL RULE: </em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">If a resident and a transitional housing provider have an agreement for that person to live in the housing unit, the transitional housing provider MUST follow California’s formal eviction process in civil court (these cases are called “unlawful detainer” actions under the law). If a transitional housing provider removes you <em>without going through the formal court process</em>, that housing provider could be subject to legal liability. If possible, talk to an lawyer or advocate at a legal aid organization about your rights (see a list of legal aid organizations across California, beginning on PG. 1075).</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>THE THPMA IS THE EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">The THPMA is a California state law and says owners of transitional housing can evict you more quickly than a normal eviction procedure ONLY IF the following 3 requirements are met:</p>
        <ol class="text">You committed “participant misconduct or abuse”; 	</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have lived in the transitional housing program for less than 6 months; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You signed a WRITTEN CONTRACT with the transitional housing provider when entering the program that explicitly stated that the THPMA applied, with information about your rights and the procedure for using the THPMA to kick someone out more quickly.</ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">What is a <em>tenant</em>?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">A tenant is a person who lives on land or in a property that is rented from a landlord.</p>
        <p class="text">ALL of these factors need to be true, and most of the time, they are not, so REMEMBER—generally you have the same rights as a <em>tenant</em> facing eviction, which means usually a transitional housing provider has to go through the court process to evict (remove) you.</p>
        <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS considered A “<em>TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM</em>” UNDER THE THPMA?</div>
        <p class="text">Under the THPMA, a transitional housing program is <em>any </em>program designed to assist homeless persons to live independently in permanent housing with <em>all</em> the following components:</p>
        <ol class="text">Residency requirements from 30 days to 24 months.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Provides comprehensive social service programs incl. individualized case mgt. and may include other services such as alcohol/substance abuse counseling, self-improvement training, employment and training, and living skills.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Provides temporary housing with structured setting and rules participants need to comply with to remain in program.</ol>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>KEY DEFINITION:</strong> “Homeless person” = This law defines a homeless person as an individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep at night, <em>or</em> lived in any temporary housing, shelter, or institution, which includes sites not ordinarily used or designed for regular sleeping. This definition also covers <em>any person living with</em> the transitional housing program participant.</p>
        <div class="questionheading"><em>WHEN</em> MAY A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS AND EVICT me MORE QUICKLY THAN the normal eviction process?</div>
        <p class="text">An operator may use the faster, expedited THPMA restraining order/injunction process only for (1) program misconduct, or (2) abuse, defined below.</p>
        <ol class="text">Program misconduct—is an <em>intentional</em> violation of the transitional housing program’s rules and regulations. The intentional violation <em>must</em> “substantially interfere with the orderly operation of the program,” <em>and</em> involve one of the following acts:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Drunkenness on site; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Unlawful use or sale of drugs; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Theft; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Arson; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Destruction of property (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site); or</ol>
        <ol class="text">Violence or threat of violence and harassment (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).</ol>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
        <ol class="text"><a id="THPMA_Abuse"></a>Abuse—is <em>intentionally or recklessly causing, or attempting to cause</em>, bodily injury or sexual assault; <em>or </em>placing someone else in reasonable fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” (against yourself, the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).</ol>
        <p class="text"><em>Even in these situations, the transitional housing provider</em> may NOT use the expedited THPMA removal process against a participant in the program<em> for 6 months or more, UNLESS </em>a restraining order (permanent injunction) or temporary restraining order (TRO) is already pending or in force against you. If the operator hasn’t started a THPMA action within 6 months of your participation in the program, then the operator must either (1) go through the form eviction (“unlawful detainer”) court process, and/or (2) use a traditional civil harassment restraining order process to remove you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1428" id="footnote-ref-1428">[1427]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <div class="questionheading">HOW could A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS?</div>
        <p class="text">If the above requirements are all met, a transitional housing program operator may:</p>
        <ol class="text">Use the formal eviction/”unlawful detainer” court process (see the GENERAL RULE on PG. 431—the THPMA gives the transitional housing owner two options for evicting someone); <em>OR</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">If program misconduct or abuse: Use the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)/injunction process under the THPMA.</ol>
        <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE TRO PROCESS?</div>
        <p class="text">The TRO process is a 2-step process:</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> The transitional housing program operator must file an application for an <em>immediate temporary restraining order</em> (TRO) until a hearing can take place. This immediate TRO may include orders that you (the program participant) refrain from misconduct, <em>or</em> it may exclude you from participating and living at the transitional housing program site, and stay at least 200 feet away from the site of <em>abuse </em>(defined above, PG. 432) was alleged.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>STEP 2:</strong> There is a <em>hearing on permanent injunction</em>—usually within in 5 days of the program operator filing the TRO. For the judge to issue a permanent injunction (permanent restraining order) at the hearing, there must be <em>clear and convincing evidence</em> of program misconduct or abuse by the participant.</p>
        <div class="questionheading">WHAT ARE “STAY AWAY” AND “EXCLUSION” ORDERS, AND WHEN CAN A PROGRAM OPERATOR GET ONE AGAINST ME?</div>
        <p class="text">These types of orders are defined below:</p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Exclusion Order: </strong>An<em> exclusion order</em> says that you are not allowed to participate or live at the program site.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>Stay Away Order:</strong> A stay away order says that you cannot be within 200 feet of the transitional housing program site or other program sites that it runs.</ol>
        <p class="text">A transitional housing program operator may only ask for exclusion and stay away orders for “abuse,” NOT for “program misconduct” (defined above on PG. 432). These orders can last for up to <em>1 year after the hearing</em>, and the operator can ask the court to renew the restraining order after that (<em>NOTE:</em> the operator must ask for an extension of the exclusion or stay away order at least 3 months before the original one expires). </p>
        <p class="text">The program operator may also be able to get an <em>immediate</em> exclusion or stay away order from the court in a temporary restraining order (TRO) hearing—but only if it’s an <em>emergency. </em>It can only be considered an emergency if it’s <em>necessary to protect</em> another participant, employee, or person living within 100 feet of the program site from “imminent serious bodily injury.”</p>
        <div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR GETS AN EXCLUSION OR “STAY AWAY” ORDER?</div>
        <p class="text"><em>Before the hearing, through a TRO,</em> the transitional housing program operator may have you immediately removed from the unit.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>After the hearing,</em> the transitional housing program operator may take immediate possession of the unit and consider it “abandoned.” If there are other people living in the unit (for example, your family members), but those other people were not named in the restraining order petition, then the program operator may <em>only remove you, and anyone actually named in the petition.</em> A copy of the order will also be given to the local police.</p>
        <div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR <em>DOESN’T</em> GET AN EXCLUSION OR STAY AWAY ORDER?</div>
        <p class="text">If you violate the conditions of the restraining order (also called a permanent injunction), the transitional housing program operator may:</p>
        <ol class="text">Serve you with a 3-day “notice to quit”—meaning you have 3 days to get you and your belongings out of the transitional housing program; and after the 3 days are up, the operator can start a formal eviction process in court (an “unlawful detainer’ action – learn more about these eviction lawsuits on PG. 393 above).</ol>
        <ol class="text">File a “contempt” action in court along with a request (called a “petition”) to modify the exiting restraining order to <em>include an exclusion order</em> (EVEN IF the original action was based only on “program misconduct”),</ol>
        <ol class="text">Finally, if you “willfully disobey” the court’s restraining order, you could be charged and possibly convicted of a criminal misdemeanor.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Below, we have copied the instructions from the California Courts for someone who is participating in a transitional housing program covered by the THPMA and who receives restraining order papers.<em> </em></ol>
        <p class="text"><em>You can download all forms related to the THPMA on the California Superior Court’s website at </em><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH</a>.</p>
        <div class="questionheading">What STEPS does THE CALIFORNIA COURT suggest I TAKE IF YOU I’m being KICKED OUT OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING UNDER THE Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)?</div>
        <p class="text">The California Courts have published instructions for people who are facing removal from transitional housing under the THMPA. Those instructions are available on court form TH-210, available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf</a>, and also copied below for your reference. </p>
        <p class="text">1. <strong>Legal advice.</strong> If you are served with an Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"] and a Petition, you should seek legal advice right away. The OSC/TRO should list the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the petition is filed. You may be able to get legal services by contacting this office. If you do not have an attorney, you can also call the attorney's referral service of your local bar association for help.</p>
        <p class="text">2. <strong>Read the Instructions.</strong> Whether or not you choose to talk to an attorney, you should read all of these instructions and the other papers you have received.</p>
        <p class="text">3. <strong>Obey the Order.</strong> Read the papers served on you very carefully. The Petition tells you what orders the program opera- tor is asking the court to make. The OSC/TRO tells you when to appear in court and may contain a temporary order telling you that you cannot do certain things. YOU HAVE TO OBEY THE ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COURT'S ORDERS, CRIMINAL CHARGES MAY BE FILED AGAINST YOU. IF YOU ARE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S ORDERS, THE COURT CAN CHANGE THE ORDERS TO FORCE YOU TO MOVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM'S HOUSING.</p>
        <p class="text">4. <strong>Review the facts.</strong> Read the description of the facts on the Petition very carefully. This is where the program operator tells the judge what he or she thinks happened. If you do not agree with the facts on the petition or you think it would not be fair for the court to grant orders against you, GO TO THE HEARING. The place and time of the hearing are on the first page of the form named "Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order."</p>
        <p class="text">5. <strong>Respond to the court.</strong> If you want to fight the petition you should file a Participant's Response. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO FILE THIS FORM. A blank copy of the Response should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO. You can also file and serve statements signed by people who have personal knowledge of the facts. These are called "declarations." You can type these declarations on form MC-031 and attach them to your Response. If you do not know how to prepare a declaration, you should see an attorney.</p>
        <p class="text">6. <strong>Serve a copy on program operator.</strong> After you have filed the Participant's Response with the superior court clerk, a copy must be delivered personally or by mail to the program operator or the program operator's attorney.</p>
        <p class="text">You cannot serve the program operator yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you. The person should complete and sign a Proof of Personal Service form. (A blank copy should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO.) You should take the completed form back to the court clerk or bring it with you to the hearing.</p>
        <p class="text">7. <strong>Extensions.</strong> If you need more time to find an attorney or to prepare your Response, you must ask the judge for a continuance (extension) by the hearing date shown on the OSC/TRO.</p>
        <p class="text">8. <strong>Opposing the Petition.</strong> If you wish to fight the lawsuit, you should file a Participant's Response and also go to the hearing. If you have any witnesses, they also must be present. If you do not attend the hearing, the court may make "permanent" orders against you that will last up to one year. If you can't file and serve a Response (or find an attorney who will), SHOW UP AT THE HEARING ANYWAY. At the hearing, explain your difficulties to the judge, and ask to be allowed to tell your side of the case.</p>

        <li id="footnote-1402"><p> Please note that the DFEH complaint process was changed starting in 2013. Previously, the Department would issue an accusation after determining that the landlord discriminated against you. You then had the right to choose between an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge, or a civil lawsuit in court. Starting in 2013, the accusation and administrative hearing option were eliminated, so DFEH must automatically file a civil lawsuit if it finds that you were discriminated against. Cal. Gov’t. Code § 12981 (effective Jan. 1, 2004–Dec. 31, 2012), repealed by 2012 Cal. Legis. Ch. 46 § 56 (S.B. 1038) (effective Jan. 1, 2013). For more information on these changes, see Phyllis W.

When deciding whether to file a civil lawsuit, the Department will consider the following factors: (1) whether there is strong evidence of discrimination; (2) whether a lawsuit is likely to be successful; (3) whether the discrimination involves an important legal issue for establishing new caselaw; (4) whether the lawsuit and its impact on civil rights are consistent with DFEH’s mission; and/or (5) whether landlord offered to resolve the issue directly and you refused. 2 Cal.
