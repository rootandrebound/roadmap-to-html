        <h1>How can I find government-assisted housing?</h1>
        <p class="text">Try the following resources to find government-assisted housing:</p>
        <ol class="text">YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA), which runs some of the biggest government-assisted housing programs, including the Public Housing program and the Housing Choice Voucher program (commonly known as ‚ÄúSection 8‚Äù or the voucher program).</ol>
        <ol class="text">SEARCH ONLINE: To find your local PHA on the web, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs (HUD) website at: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm</a>. Once at the website, select your state, then, look for your local PHA by the name of your city or county.</ol>
        <ol class="text">SEARCH IN THE PHONE BOOK: If you don‚Äôt have a regular access to a computer, look in your phone book in the government or business sections for your local Public Housing Authority (PHA). Some areas have both city and county PHAs; others just have a city PHA. In the government section of the phone book, first look for the city, then look for ‚Äúhousing authority‚Äù or ‚Äúhousing department‚Äù (for example, the San Francisco Housing Authority, or the Oakland Housing Authority). Sometimes, the local PHA will be listed under the city‚Äôs housing department.</ol>
        <ol class="text">OTHER GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, NOT THROUGH YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA):</ol>
        <ol class="text">PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT LANDLORDS operate other forms of government-assisted rental housing programs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains a searchable list of these programs online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm</a> </ol>
        <ol class="text">LOW INCOME TAX CREDIT HOUSING¬†is an affordable rental housing developed through the Internal Revenue Services‚Äô (IRS) Low Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC). Typically, this housing does not serve extremely low-income households, but it is less expensive than similar private housing in the community. LIHTC housing is owned and operated by private owners and nonprofit agencies and is monitored in each state by a state agency. Frequently, but not always, that agency is the state housing finance agency. Some of these agencies may have lists of persons and organizations that operate LIHTC housing in your state. In CA, it‚Äôs the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee that oversees LIHTC. Read more about these types of property at: <a href="http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/tax.asp">http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/tax.asp</a> </ol>
        <ol class="text">RURAL HOUSING: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)¬†also funds government-assisted rental housing in rural areas throughout the United States and maintains a website that allows you to¬†search for rural government-assisted rental housing here: <a href="http://rdmfhrentals.sc.egov.usda.gov/RDMFHRentals/select_state.jsp">http://rdmfhrentals.sc.egov.usda.gov/RDMFHRentals/select_state.jsp</a> </ol>
