        <h1>Access to Your Criminal Records As You Apply For Government-Assisted Housing:</h1>
        <p class="text">When you apply to PHAs and/or owners of government-assisted housing, they can research you to decide whether you should be accepted or rejected. To do this research, they are allowed to access different kinds of records. There are rules for how they can access and use these records, described below, so keep reading! </p>
        <p class="text">PLEASE NOTE: There are different rules for how PHAs and owners of federal government-assisted housing can access and use your criminal history records. In sum, the PHA can get more information about your criminal history than an owner of government-assisted housing. We will explain how each gets access to your criminal history information below. </p>
