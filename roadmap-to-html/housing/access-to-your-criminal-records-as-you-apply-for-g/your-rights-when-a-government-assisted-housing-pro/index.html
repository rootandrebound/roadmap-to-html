        <h1>Your Rights When a Government-assisted Housing Provider Runs a Criminal Background Check—The Rules They Must Follow</h1>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The most common way that most PHAs AND owners of government-assisted housing (as well as private owners) access your criminal history information is by ordering private background check companies to run “tenant screening reports”. </p>

            <p class="text">As discussed on PG. 372, a tenant screening report is a background check done by a private company or credit bureau on a housing applicant. It reports credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries on sex offender registers and/or other public databases, driving records, and more. A tenant report may also include information gathered from personal interviews with your neighbors, former landlords, or coworkers.</p>

            <p class="text">Many private background check companies provide tenant screening reports, including the 3 national credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.</p>

            <p class="text">No, not if you are applying to government-assisted housing—neither a PHA nor an owner can charge you to run a criminal background check or “tenant report.”</p>

            <ul class="textbox"><strong>The PHA must make sure the criminal records are true and accurate. </strong>After the PHA has you sign a <em>release</em> of criminal records information and submits that release to the law enforcement agency that holds the criminal records, it may receive a response that there is a match based on your name, date of birth, and social security number. The PHA cannot deny admission based on this information alone; the PHA must verify the match with a positive fingerprint comparison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1299" id="footnote-ref-1299">[1298]</a></sup></sup><strong>The PHA must give you notice of any proposed action that could harm you. </strong>A PHA must notify the household of any proposed action that could harm you (called an “adverse action” notice). The PHA must also provide a copy of the criminal record information to the person who was the subject of the record—as well as to the applicant, if that’s a different person.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1300" id="footnote-ref-1300">[1299]</a></sup></sup><strong>The PHA must give you an opportunity to challenge the criminal record information. </strong>The person whose information was relied on must be given an opportunity to dispute the proposed negative action.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1301" id="footnote-ref-1301">[1300]</a></sup></sup> NOTE: Even if you don’t have an automatic legal right to a review hearing, you can always ask for one!

            <li id="footnote-1300"><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(2). There are conflicting interests involved in providing the criminal record to both the applicant and the member of the family subject to the criminal record. The FBI “commented that dissemination of criminal records is limited to those with authorization (such as the PHA) and the person who is the ‘subject’ of the record, not to other persons in the household.” 66 Fed. Reg. 28,776, 28,789 (May 24, 2001). HUD disagreed, contending that under its statutory authority, it is required to provide the information to the applicant or tenant so that the applicant or tenant may dispute the determination. <a href="#footnote-ref-1300">↑</a></p></li>
            <li id="footnote-1301"><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(2); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(f); see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 960.204(c), 966.4(l)(5)(iv) (public housing) and 982.553(d) (voucher). The notice and opportunity to contest must also be provided in the case of an eviction or lease enforcement action. <a href="#footnote-ref-1301">↑</a></p></li>
            <li id="footnote-1302"><p> Special Note for Advocates: The statutory language shows a policy concern that PHAs maintain the confidentiality of criminal records obtained through the federally authorized process. However, the regulation states that it is not applicable to public information or to criminal records information obtained from law enforcement agencies if the information was not sought pursuant to the regulations. 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.901(c), 5.905(c)(2). This exemption may be too broad. The meaning and full effect of the exclusion and its consistency with the statute has not been tested. The concern is that this may mean that if a PHA obtains information from a private consumer reports agency, it may not have to abide by the confidentiality provisions of the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681u. Additionally, the confidentiality provisions of the statute most likely do not cover information the PHA or owner obtains from other sources, such as police blotters and newspaper reports. Nevertheless, advocates should argue that any information obtained from law enforcement agencies that is not otherwise publicly available should be subject to the statutory protections. 24 C.F.R. § 5.901(c). With respect to the management of the records, the statute references “any criminal records received,” whereas other provisions of the statute are limited to information received under the subsection. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q), § 13663(f); see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.307(b)(2) (PHA may provide voucher landlords information in PHA files). <a href="#footnote-ref-1302">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text"><strong><em>The General Rule:</em> </strong>In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 366) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG. 359 of this Chapter to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>Special Rule for the Public Housing &amp; “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher Programs:</em></strong> If you applied through a PHA for Public Housing or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers, there is a special rule that says PHAs and owners of the government-assisted housing cannot take any “negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with” the laws and regulations governing access to your criminal records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1304" id="footnote-ref-1304">[1303]</a></sup></sup> A negligent action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing knew or should have known that their access to your records violated the law. A knowing action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing <em>actually knew</em> that its access to your records violated the law. </p>
            <p class="text">A PHA or owner MAY BE LIABLE for negligence if they do any of the following:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1305" id="footnote-ref-1305">[1304]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <ol class="text">Improperly disclose a criminal record;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Improperly use a consent form (a.k.a. a “release” form); </ol>
            <ol class="text">Fail to <em>notify you</em> of the criminal history information collected; </ol>
            <ol class="text">Fail to <em>provide you</em> with a copy of the information collected (whether you are an applicant or a current tenant); <em>and/or</em></ol>
            <ol class="text">Fail to <em>allow you the right to dispute</em> the information. </ol>
            <p class="text">In this situation, it’s best to talk to a lawyer! You could recover attorney’s fees and other litigation costs as part of the relief you get in court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1306" id="footnote-ref-1306">[1305]</a></sup></sup> See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1075 to contact an organization that may be able to provide you legal assistance. </p>
