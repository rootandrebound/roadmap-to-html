        <h1>What bans are allowed, but not legally required in government-assisted housing‚Äîthe ‚Äúcatch-all‚Äù category of bans that apply to *all people with criminal records*?</h1>
        <p class="text">For the many of you who do not fall into one of the required (‚Äúmandatory‚Äù) bans discussed above, it‚Äôs more likely you could get denied government-assisted housing because the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or the owner of the government-assisted housing has decided based on your criminal record that you <em>currently</em> ‚Äúpose a risk to the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property by other residents, the owner, or the PHA staff or agents/contractors.‚Äù<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1228" id="footnote-ref-1228">[1227]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <p class="text">This is a ‚Äúcatch-all‚Äù category and allows the PHA or owner of government-assisted property to deny applicants with criminal histories more generally. They are allowed to consider a lot of information, including past convictions (even convictions you had expunged); arrests (even those that never led to a conviction); and in some cases your drug treatment records. See PG.¬†374 for detailed information about what criminal records a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted property can access about you.</p>
