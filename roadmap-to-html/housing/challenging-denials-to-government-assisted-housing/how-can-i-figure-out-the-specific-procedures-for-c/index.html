        <h1>How can I figure out the specific procedures for challenging a denial to government-assisted housing?</h1>
        <p class="text">The notice will tell you the specific procedure for challenging the denial for that particular housing program. The first step in challenging any denial, however, is always to submit a WRITTEN request for a review hearing, where you can fight the denial. By law, you<em> almost always</em> have the right to a review of denial from government-assisted housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1334" id="footnote-ref-1334">[1333]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <p class="text">The notice of denial will tell you who to send the written request for a review hearing to AND when you need to do it (the timing deadline by which you have to challenge the denial).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1335" id="footnote-ref-1335">[1334]</a></sup></sup> The time frames must be “reasonable”—which usually means within 10-30 days.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1336" id="footnote-ref-1336">[1335]</a></sup></sup> Follow the deadlines that you are given! </p>
        <p class="sidebox">Although not required, the denial letter (rejection notice) should also state the <em>legal services offices nearest to you</em>. If its does, call that office for extra help!</p>
        <p class="text">In sum, if you were denied from housing because of your record and you want to fight it, your first step will be to request a review hearing in writing, and you always should. <em>ALWAYS ASK FOR A HEARING WITHIN THE DEADLINE LISTED ON YOUR DENIAL NOTICE—and follow all of the procedures the notice gives you!</em></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! ASK YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COME TO THE HEARING WITH YOU! If there are individuals who are willing to accompany you to your hearing and testify (talk about how your circumstances have changed and to support your housing application), their attendance can help!</p>
