        <h1>Challenging Denials to Government-Assisted Housing</h1>
        <p class="textbox">This section will help you understand how to challenge a denial from a federal government-assisted housing program, and what to expect in the process. If you are denied government-assisted housing, you have the right to receive notice of the denial with the SPECIFIC REASONS for the denial‚Äîincluding anything that came up in your criminal records (see PG.¬†56 for what PHAs and government-assisted owners can access). You also have the right to a review of the denial‚Äîwhich could be a very informal meeting or hearing (see PG.¬†78 about what those look like) and the right to receive information on how to prepare for that informal hearing/review. You also have rights during the review hearing process AND the right to challenge the decision if you still disagree. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
