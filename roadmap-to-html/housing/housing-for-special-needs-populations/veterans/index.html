        <h1>Veterans</h1>
        <p class="text">The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) offers a variety of housing programs for veterans. </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">If you are currently incarcerated</span>—whether in a state or federal facility—a “VA Reentry Specialist” is supposed to arrange a meeting with you about your goals to determine the resources available to best meet your needs after release.</p>
        <h5 class="question">What is VA Reentry Specialist and how can I contact one to help me find housing?</h5>
        <p class="text">Every region of the U.S. has a VA Reentry Specialist who can help determine your eligibility for VA benefits, help you enroll in the VA, and connect you with local housing and services.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1084" id="footnote-ref-1084">[1084]</a></sup></sup> VA Reentry Specialists have relationships with both state and federal correctional facilities to help incarcerated veterans plan and prepare for release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1085" id="footnote-ref-1085">[1085]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">If you already met with the VA Reentry Specialist and received instructions for housing, you should continue with those arrangements. If you are starting from scratch, the VA’s Health Care for Homeless Veteran program can help you find housing in your area. You should visit your local VA, if possible, or call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans hotline available 24/7 at 1-877-4-AID-VET (424-3838). There you will find a VA counselor available to help you.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL RESOURCES</h4>
        <p class="textbox">To learn more about preparing for release as a veteran, go to the VA website:<br/><a href="http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/Reentry/09_ca.pdf">http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/Reentry/09_ca.pdf</a>.AFTER YOU ARE RELEASE, you can visit this website to find your local VA: <a href="http://www.cacvso.org/county-contacts/">http://www.cacvso.org/county-contacts/</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="subheading3">Your VA Housing options include the following programs:</h4>
        <p><strong><em>HEALTH CARE FOR HOMELESS VETERANS CONTRACTS (HCHV) –</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">The HCHV program provides emergency housing, shelters, and treatment to veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare, through local community organizations and service providers. These local community organizations and service providers may offer outreach, exams, treatment, referrals, and case management to veterans who are homeless and dealing with mental health issues.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1086" id="footnote-ref-1086">[1086]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <ol class="text">For information about the HCHV program, please visit: <a href="http://www.va.gov/homeless/hchv.asp">http://www.va.gov/homeless/hchv.asp</a> </ol>
        <ol class="text">For list of HCHV coordinators in California, please visit: <a href="http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/HCHV_Sites_ByState.pdf">http://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/HCHV_Sites_ByState.pdf</a> </ol>
        <p><strong><em>SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR VETERAN FAMILIES GRANTS (SSVF) –</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">Local non-profit organizations receive funding from the VA to assist low-income veterans (and their families) who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. SSVF programs can help you transition to permanent housing, along with case management and assistance with getting other benefits and services.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1087" id="footnote-ref-1087">[1087]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <p class="text">For a list of current SSVF providers, please visit the following website: <a href="http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp">http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp</a> </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTConnecting with legal services providers through an SSVF program:</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Participating SSVF programs may provide or may contract with local legal aid organizations to provide Veterans with legal services. <em>(Veterans ineligible for VA Enrollment may be eligible to receive SSVF assistance if available. Inquire at your VA if this option is an option for you).</em></p>
        <p><strong><em>VA SUPPORTIVE HOUSING (HUD-VASH) PROGRAM –</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">HUD-VASH is a joint effort between HUD (US Department of Housing and Urban Development) and VA to move veterans and their families out of homelessness and into permanent housing. HUD provides Section 8 vouchers to eligible veterans, and the VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its health care system. </p>
        <p class="text">Veterans applying for Section 8 Housing Vouchers through the HUD-VASH program are subject to most Section 8 Housing eligibility rules (for example, your income).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1088" id="footnote-ref-1088">[1088]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <p class="importantbox">THERE IS AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO CRIMINAL RECORD BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING FOR VETERANS: HUD-VASH applicants <em>are not subject to most Section 8 regulations regarding criminal and/or drug-related history</em>. This means that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) cannot deny Section 8 housing to HUD-VASH applicants based off the applicant’s prior drug activity or criminal record (unless you or someone in your household is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration—know as “290 registration” in California—in which case the PHA can still deny you and your household from Section 8 housing programs).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1089" id="footnote-ref-1089">[1089]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <p><strong><em>MENTAL HEALTH RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION AND TREATMENT (MH RRTP) PROGRAMS—</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">MH RRTP provide residential rehabilitation and treatment services for veterans with multiple and severe medical conditions, mental illness, addiction, or psychosocial deficits.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1090" id="footnote-ref-1090">[1090]</a></sup></sup></span> MH RRTP programs promote rehabilitation, recovery, health maintenance, improved quality of life, and community integration, in addition to treatment of medical conditions, mental illnesses, addictive disorders, and homelessness. The residential program helps veterans to develop a lifestyle self-care, personal responsibility, and medical health.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1091" id="footnote-ref-1091">[1091]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <ol class="text">For more information about MH RRTP and other residential VA programs, please visit the following website: <a href="https://www.calvet.ca.gov/VetHomes">https://www.calvet.ca.gov/VetHomes</a></ol>
        <ol class="text">Please note: VA Housing providers are required to verify you are free of Tuberculosis (Tb). If you have had a Tb test within the past year, you should request a copy of the results before your release from incarceration. If you do not have a recent Tb clearance, request the test so you can have this document available.</ol>
        <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Substance_abuse"></a><a id="Sober_living_environment"></a><a id="_Toc448153120"></a>Substance Abuse Treatment &amp; Recovery Housing (also called “Sober Living Environments” or SLE) </h3>
        <p class="text">If you suffer from past addiction or alcoholism, you may be eligible for special housing and/or funding programs that provide residential treatment for substance abuse. These are also called “Sober Living Environments” (SLEs). More information about funding and these residential facilities can be found on CDCR’s website here: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/substance-abuse-services-coordination-agencies.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/substance-abuse-services-coordination-agencies.html</a>.</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>FUNDING:</em> If you are on state parole, you may be eligible for temporary funding through CDCR’s Substance Abuse Service Coordination Agencies (SASCA) funding or another source.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1092" id="footnote-ref-1092">[1092]</a></sup></sup> SASCA funding is generally limited to 6 months of assistance. Ask your state parole officer for more information.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>SPECIAL HOUSING:</em> There are transitional housing programs that focus on substance abuse treatment and/or sober living conditions for people with former addictions. They may also take SASCA funding. Be aware that many of these programs are only available for short- or medium-term stays. </ol>
        <h5 class="question">My conviction was for past drug or alcohol use. Is past addiction considered a legally protected disability?</h5>
        <p class="answer">Yes. Past (BUT NOT CURRENT) drug addiction and alcoholism are considered disabilities under state and federal law. This means you may have the right to request <em>reasonable accommodations</em> for your disability.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1093" id="footnote-ref-1093">[1093]</a></sup></sup></span> Reasonable accommodations might include an extended curfew so that you can attend treatment or AA/NA programs, permission to take methadone if prescribed by your doctor, or access to special rehabilitative services. Moreover, a landlord may not deny you housing or discriminate against you based on your past addiction or alcoholism.For more information on housing protections for people with addiction-based disabilities, including what information a landlord CAN and CANNOT ask or consider, the following guide may be helpful: <em>Fair Housing for People with Disabilities</em>, by Mental Health Advocacy Services, Inc., pages 18-20, available online at: <a href="http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf">http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf</a>.For more information on asking for reasonable accommodations—where you could ask a landlord to make an exception to their policy banning former addicts from housing (since past addiction is a protected disability), go to Appendix D, PG. 453.</p>
