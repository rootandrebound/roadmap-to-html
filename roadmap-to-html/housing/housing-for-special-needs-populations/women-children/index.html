        <h1>Women & Children</h1>
        <h4 class="sidebox">DID YOU KNOW? </h4>
        <p class="sidebox">70-80% of women incarcerated in California prisons are mothers, and the majority were the primary caretakers of their children before going to prison. <em>See</em> Barbara Bloom, <em>The Impact of California’s Parole Policies on Women, Testimony Before the Little Hoover Commission</em> (April 22, 2004).</p>
        <p class="text">There are some special housing programs available only for women and their children. These programs may have other requirements (for example, that you are currently on supervision, participating in a substance abuse recovery program, etc.), and they may require a referral from CDCR or another agency.</p>
        <p class="text">Since there are very few of these programs and they have limited in space, you should contact the program and/or talk to your correctional counselor as soon as possible about contacting the housing program, finding out if you meet the eligibility requirements to participate, and how to get added to the waitlist if there is one.</p>
        <p class="text">Below are a few programs in different areas of California for reentering women and children. Please Note: This is not a complete list.</p>
        <ol class="text">Centerforce MOMS Program at Santa Rita Jail (in Alameda County, CA):</ol>
