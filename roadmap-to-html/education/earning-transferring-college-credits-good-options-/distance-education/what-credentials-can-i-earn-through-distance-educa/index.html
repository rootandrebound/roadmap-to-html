        <h1>What credentials can I earn through distance education?</h1>
        <p class="text">Thanks to the Internet, you can earn pretty much any credential through a Distance Education program that you can earn through a traditional educational program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2868" id="footnote-ref-2868">[2867]</a></sup> This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor‚Äôs degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. Distance Education programs are offered in most major CTE and college degree program areas. Program quality does vary greatly, however. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">WARNING: While many accredited, reputable schools offer credential programs through Distance education, there are also plenty of scam programs that will take your money and leave you with a useless piece of paper. (For more information on spotting Distance Education scam programs, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG.¬†839.)</p>
