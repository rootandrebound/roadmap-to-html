        <p class="text">Depending on your career goals, your life situation, and your access to resources like financial aid, college may or may not be the best option for you now. The following sections of this chapter will provide details about the different types of college degree programs so that you can make an informed decision.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862068"></a>What are the different kinds of academic degrees? </h3>
        <p class="text">There are three main categories of college degrees: </p>
        <ol class="text">Associate degrees</ol>
        <ol class="text">Bachelor‚Äôs degrees</ol>
        <ol class="text">Graduate Academic and Professional degrees. </ol>
        <p class="text">Different degrees are awarded in different subject and career areas, and they all have different requirements. For some degrees you have to earn another degree first, before you can pursue them. The various degrees are discussed in detail below.</p>

        <h3><a id="_Toc352862070"></a>What is an associate degree? </h3>
        <p class="text">An associate degree (sometimes called a ‚Äútwo-year‚Äù degree) is an undergraduate college degree that is awarded by community and junior colleges (sometimes called ‚Äútwo-year colleges‚Äù), technical schools, and some four-year colleges and universities. Associate degree programs are designed to take two years of full-time study to complete (but part-time students may take longer), and generally require students to take various general education courses like English, math, and science. An associate degree can be a stepping-stone toward earning a bachelor‚Äôs degree or can prepare you to enter the workforce directly.<sup><a href="#footnote-2831" id="footnote-ref-2831">[2830]</a></sup> </p>
