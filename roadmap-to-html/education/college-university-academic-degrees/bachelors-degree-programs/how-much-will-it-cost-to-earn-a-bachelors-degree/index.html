        <h1>How much will it cost to earn a Bachelor’s degree?</h1>
        <p class="text">Bachelor’s degrees from four-year colleges and universities are expensive. They can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most people require financial assistance from federal or state student aid programs, or from private organizations to pay their tuition. (For information on Paying for College, see PG. 871.)</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">A NOTE ON PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE SCHOOLS</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Both public and private colleges and universities offer Bachelor’s degree programs. <span class="emphasisitalic">Public schools</span> are partially funded by government taxes and usually charge lower tuition (especially for in-state residents). They tend to have a larger student population and larger class sizes. <span class="emphasisitalic">Private schools</span> are generally more expensive, and tend to focus on keeping classes small and exposing students to many different subjects.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2843" id="footnote-ref-2843">[2842]</a></sup><strong>A NOTE ABOUT IN-STATE TUITION:</strong> Most schools require that you have lived in California for a certain period of time in order to get the discounted “resident” or “in-state” tuition rate. <sup><a href="#footnote-2844" id="footnote-ref-2844">[2843]</a></sup> Some schools will consider time that you spent incarcerated in California towards this requirement. Check with your school’s admissions and financial aid offices to find out if your period of incarceration qualifies you as a California resident under that school’s policy. </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862080"></a>How do I find a Bachelor’s degree program? </h3>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">If you’re currently incarcerated</span></p>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Earn college credits.</span> Unfortunately, at the time of this publication, there currently are no four-year Bachelor’s degree programs offered in federal, state, or county correctional facilities in California, and correspondence courses that advertise four-year degrees should not be trusted. However, you can earn college credits while you are incarcerated which can be applied toward a four-year degree after you are released. (For information on how to earn college credits while you are incarcerated, see Associate Degree Programs, PG. 858, and Distance Education, PG. 866. For information on how to transfer college credits that you earn while you are incarcerated, see PG. 865. For information on how to tell if a school or program is a scam, see PG. 839.)</ol>
        <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Plan and Prepare.</span> There is plenty you can do to plan and prepare for your post-release education while you are still incarcerated. You can research schools (see PG. 854), complete applications (see PG. 846), take placement tests (see PG. 843), and apply for financial aid (see PG. 871)</ol>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">If you’re formerly incarcerated</span></p>
        <ol class="text">Visit your public library and ask the librarian to show you to the section on college guides.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Search colleges and universities on the Internet. You can search based on location, cost, program or degree options, or rankings.</ol>
