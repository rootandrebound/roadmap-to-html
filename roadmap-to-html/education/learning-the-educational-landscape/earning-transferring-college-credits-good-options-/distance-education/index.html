            <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Distance Education</span> (also called Distance Learning) is an education program that uses various technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the teacher. It is a way for students to take a formal course of study (high school, vocational, or college-level) without having to travel to the classroom. Although the students and the teachers are separated, the hallmark of Distance Education is regular and substantial interaction between them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2863" id="footnote-ref-2863">[2862]</a></sup> Distance Education courses usually incorporate multiple forms of media, including printed materials, CDs or DVDs, audio recordings, telephone communication, audio or video conferencing, email, and Web-casts and Internet streaming. There are two types of Distance Education interaction modes: “synchronous” and “asynchronous” instruction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2864" id="footnote-ref-2864">[2863]</a></sup> </p>

            <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Synchronous instruction</span> means that all of the students and the instructor(s) participate in the class at the same time, even though they are not in the same place. This is usually done through “live” teleconferencing, video conferencing web conferencing, or Internet chats. The class is given at a set time, and everyone calls or logs in at that time to participate. Synchronous courses can offer a level of interactivity similar to that of a traditional face-to-face class.<sup><a href="#footnote-2865" id="footnote-ref-2865">[2864]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Asynchronous instruction</span> does not require that the student(s) and the instructor(s) participate at the same time. Students choose when they want to study the course materials or interact with the instructor(s). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible than synchronous instruction, but offers less interactivity because it is not “live.” In asynchronous instruction, course materials and communications are often delivered via CDs or DVDs, by traditional mail correspondence, or through e-mails, listservs and Internet downloads.<sup><a href="#footnote-2866" id="footnote-ref-2866">[2865]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">Thanks to the Internet, you can earn pretty much any credential through a Distance Education program that you can earn through a traditional educational program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2868" id="footnote-ref-2868">[2867]</a></sup> This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees.

            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintACCREDITATION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS</h4>
            <p class="textbox">There are numerous commercial websites that advertise hundreds of Distance Education programs and schools in the U.S. and abroad. However, keep in mind that schools and programs pay to be listed on these websites. This means that when you search these sites, only those that have paid will come up—you will not see the rest of the schools and programs out there, so the results of your search will be limited. Also, many of these websites claim that they only list “accredited” schools and programs, however, you should always do your own research to make sure that a school or Distance Education program is 1) legitimate and 2) recognized by an approved accrediting agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2869" id="footnote-ref-2869">[2868]</a></sup> (For more information on accreditation and scam programs, see <em>Choosing Your Educational Path</em>, PG. 839.)</p>

            <p class="text">The cost of Distance Education programs varies based on the type of program, the delivery media, and the institution that it is offered through. Programs offered through four-year colleges and more prestigious schools will be more expensive than those offered through local community colleges. </p>
            <h4>Two important things to note about Paying for Distance Education: </h4>
            <ol class="text">Distance Education and Fee Waivers</ol>
            <p class="text">Distance Education programs offered through California community colleges may qualify for an enrollment fee waiver through the California Community Colleges Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver program. (For more information on this program and how to qualify, see <em>Paying For Your Education</em>, PG. 871.)</p>
            <ol class="text">Distance Education and Financial Aid</ol>
            <p class="text">You may be able to get financial aid to help you pay for your Distance Education courses. Only accredited Distance Education institutions are allowed to participate in federal financial aid programs. Even if a school or program is eligible to participate, it must choose to do so. To find out if financial aid is available for a particular school or program, check with that institution’s financial aid office (For more information on financial aid, see <em>Paying For Your Education</em>, PG. 871).</p>
            <h3 class="subheading2"> <a id="Educ_CorrespondenceCourses"></a><a id="_Toc352862096"></a>Correspondence courses</h3>
            <p class="text">A correspondence course is a course offered by a school or program, where the student is separated from the teacher and course materials are provided through the mail or over the Internet. There is very little interaction between the student and the teacher, communication is usually initiated by the student (whenever the student wants), and students work at their own pace. Although there are some similarities, correspondence courses are not considered a type of distance education under federal law (see the table below for key differences).<sup><a href="#footnote-2870" id="footnote-ref-2870">[2869]</a></sup> </p>
            <h4>The Difference Between Distance Education and Correspondence Courses</h4>
            <p class="text">Although these two terms seem similar and are often confused, they refer to two different learning situations. Distance Education is generally an option that requires Internet access. Although Distance Education is one option to earn credit, due to the need of media/ Internet access, it may not be a possible option for an individual who is currently incarcerated.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Two great resources for researching correspondence programs from inside are: </em></p>
            <ol class="text"><em>Prisoners’ Guerrilla Handbook to Correspondence Programs in the United States and Canada</em> by Jon Marc Taylor. This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence courses available to incarcerated people, providing detailed program overviews and contact information. At the time of this publication, the handbook is in its 3rd edition, published in 2009 (ISBN: 978-0981938509). Check your facility’s library or education department. It is also available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a> and Barnes &amp; Noble (both are CDCR approved vendors).

            <ol class="text"><em>Prison Education Guide</em> by Christopher Zoukis and edited by Susan Schwartzkopf (through Prison Legal News Publishing). This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence programs for prisoners that It includes a detailed analysis of the quality, cost, and course offerings of all college correspondence programs available to prisoners. The publication costs $49.95, and will be available beginning March 1, 2016 (taking pre-orders now online at <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/prison-education-guide/">https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/prison-education-guide/</a>).

            <ol class="text">Also, see Appendix D, PG. 888 for a list of schools that have a history of successfully offering correspondence courses to incarcerated individuals (working within correctional facility restrictions).</ol>
            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintStudent Responsibilities for Correspondence Courses</h4>
            <p class="textbox">If you enroll in a correspondence course while you are incarcerated, you will be responsible for getting all of the required textbooks and materials yourself. You may also be responsible for finding a “proctor” at your institution to administer any midterm or final exams. A proctor is someone who watches over you while you take your exam to make sure that you are the one actually taking the exam, and that you do not cheat. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re formerly incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
            <ol class="text">See Appendix D, PG. 888 for a list of schools known to offer correspondence courses;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Check your local public library for information on schools that offer correspondence courses;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Visit your local America’s Job Centers of California and ask about correspondence programs. </ol>
            <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Once you have returned to the community, you will have access to more resources, including the Internet, than when you were incarcerated. We recommend that you take advantage of interactive Distance Education programs or traditional face-to-face programs, as these tend to offer a richer and more integrated educational experience than correspondence courses. </p>
            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintPaying for Correspondence Course</h4>
            <p class="textbox">You may be eligible to receive financial aid to pay for your correspondence study, but it depends on the school you are taking courses through. Because of federal regulations, schools that offer primarily correspondence courses are not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs. If more than 50% of the courses the institution offers are correspondence courses, or more than 50% of the students enrolled are taking correspondence courses, then the school is not eligible for federal financial aid. Additionally, a school is not eligible if more than 25% of its students are incarcerated.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2872" id="footnote-ref-2872">[2871]</a></sup> </sup>(For more information on financial aid, see Paying For Your Education, PG. 871.)</p>
