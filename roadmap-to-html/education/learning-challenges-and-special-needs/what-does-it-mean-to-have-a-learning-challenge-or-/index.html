        <h1>What does it mean to have a learning challenge or special need?</h1>
        <p class="text">Each of us learns in our own way and at our own speed. However, for many people, their brains have particular trouble receiving, storing, processing, retrieving, or communicating information.<sup><a href="#footnote-2727" id="footnote-ref-2727">[2726]</a></sup> The brain‚Äôs trouble with these things is called a learning challenge (often called a ‚Äúlearning disability‚Äù). Unfortunately, many people have struggled in school their whole lives, but do not realize that their difficulties stem from learning challenges that can be overcome. Many people with learning challenges are able to prosper in school if they get the proper guidance, support, and instruction. The most common learning challenges are: </p>
        <ol class="text">Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)‚Äîinability to control behavior or pay attention, often accompanied by hyperactivity.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Dyslexia‚Äîdifficulty reading, understanding, and processing written words.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Dyscalculia‚Äîdifficulty with number values, calculations, and math concepts.</ol>
        <p class="text">There are many other types of learning challenges, including those related to writing, processing visual or sound information, memory, organization, and attention to detail. If certain subjects‚Äîor school in general‚Äîalways seemed difficult for you, you may suffer from a learning challenge that was not discovered. For more information about learning challenges, visit the Learning Disabilities Association of America at <a href="http://ldaamerica.org/adult-learning-disability-assessment-process/">http://ldaamerica.org/adult-learning-disability-assessment-process/</a>, or the National Association for Adults with Learning Disabilities at <a href="http://naasln.org/">http://naasln.org/</a>. </p>
