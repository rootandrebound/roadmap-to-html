        <h1>Higher education overview</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>Once you’ve earned your high school credential, what’s next? It’s time to revisit your long-term educational and career goals. Do you need a certain skill-set or type of training for your desired career field? Do you have to earn a specific degree to practice in your chosen profession? If so, “higher education” might be right for you. </em></p>

          <h3><a href="/roadmap-to-html/education/higher-education-overview/what-is-higher-education/">What is higher education?</a></h3>
            <p class="text">“Higher education” refers to additional schooling that you take beyond the high school-level, that leads to a professional certification or academic degree, such as a Career and Technical Education (CTE) certificate, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or graduate or professional degree. If you plan on continuing your education beyond the high school-level, you will need to determine which higher education path fits your needs and goals.</p>
            <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT TYPE OF VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE? </h4>
            <p class="sidebox">CTE programs commonly cover fields such as: agriculture and natural resources, arts and media, building and construction, education and child/family services, energy and utilities, fashion and design, finance and business, health science and medical technology, hospitality and tourism, information technology, manufacturing and product development, marketing and sales, public services, or transportation services.<strong> </strong></p>
