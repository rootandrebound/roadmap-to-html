        <h1>Board of Governor‚Äôs Fee Waiver (BOGFW): Free Enrollment for low-income students to california community colleges</h1>
        <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE ABOUT CHANGE IN LAW FOR TANF/CALWORKS: </h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you were qualified for TANF/Calworks but found ineligible because of a drug conviction, your criminal history would have previously disqualified you from the BOGFW program (see PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER, PG.¬†444, for details about TANF/CalWORKS eligibility). However, this law changed on April 1, 2015. After that date, your conviction history no longer makes you ineligible for TANF/CalWORKS benefits, so you may be able to qualify for BOGFW now.</p>
        <p class="text">The Board of Governor‚Äôs Fee Waiver (BOGFW) program waives enrollment fees for California Community Colleges for qualified low-income students. If you qualify for this waiver, you can go to community college for free (NOTE: you will still have to pay for other education expenses, such as course materials and supplies). If you are taking a correspondence course through a California Community College while you are incarcerated, you may qualify for a BOGFW‚Äîkeep reading to learn more.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862125"></a>How do I know if I qualify for BOGFW?<sup><a href="#footnote-2909" id="footnote-ref-2909">[2908]</a></sup></h3>
        <p class="text">First, to qualify for the Board of Governor‚Äôs Fee Waiver, you must be a California resident. If you are a CA resident, you must also qualify based on one of several other criteria, for example, if you receive government benefits or fall into an eligible income bracket. (For a full list of BOGFW qualifications, see Appendix¬†I, PG.¬†904; for a 2015-16 BOGFW Application, see Appendix¬†J, PG.¬†906.)</p>

            <p class="text">Maybe. If you are still incarcerated, you are disqualified from receiving any type of Cal Grant financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-2910" id="footnote-ref-2910">[2909]</a></sup> Additionally, certain drug convictions may make you ineligible for a Board of Governor‚Äôs Fee Waiver.</p>
            <h3> <a id="_Toc352862127"></a>How do I apply for state-based student aid?</h3>
            <p class="text">In order to apply for California-based financial aid, you will need to fill out either the FAFSA (see above) or the California Dream Act application, and submit your certified GPA to the Student Aid Commission. For detailed instructions on how to apply for state-based financial aid in California, visit the California Student Aid Commission website at: <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/">http://consumerfinance.gov/</a>, or speak to a counselor in your school‚Äôs financial aid office. </p>
