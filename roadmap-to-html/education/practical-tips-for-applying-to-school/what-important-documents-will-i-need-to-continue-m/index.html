        <h1>What important documents will I need to continue my education?</h1>
        <p class="text">In general, these are the documents you’ll need to have ready as you apply for schools, programs, and financial aid. You may not need all of these, and/or may need others that are not on this list. Check the requirements listed on the school, program, or aid application to be absolutely sure. (NOTE: You can start the process of getting some of these documents while you are still incarcerated): </p>
        <ol class="text"><strong>High school credential and/or transcripts</strong> (see PG. 847)</ol>
        <ol class="text"><strong>College credential and/or transcripts</strong> (see PG. 857)</ol>

        <ol class="text"><strong>List of References</strong> (people who can speak positively of you to schools or programs where you apply)<sup><a href="#footnote-2667" id="footnote-ref-2667">[2666]</a></sup> </ol>

        <h3><a id="_Toc352862006"></a><a id="Educ_ImmunizationRecords"></a>What are “immunization/vaccination records” and why do I need them? </h3>
        <p class="text">Your immunization record (also called your vaccination record) is a list of all the vaccines (medicines) you received as a child and as an adult that prevent common diseases like polio, chicken pox and tuberculosis. It is required to register for school, for certain jobs, and/or to travel abroad.</p>
