        <h1>How much time will it take to earn my high school diploma?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, life circumstances, and learning preferences. Depending on the program you enroll in, you might work toward your diploma individually, at your own pace; or you might work with a teacher who creates assignment deadlines and a long-term schedule for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2790" id="footnote-ref-2790">[2789]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL TIPS</h4>
        <p class="textbox">If you’ve already completed many of the courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, an adult high school diploma program is likely a faster route for you than the GED.If you haven’t completed many high school courses, the GED will probably be a faster path to your high school equivalency certificate.<span class="emphasisitalic">But consider</span>, if you have not taken many high school courses yet, and you have some time to spend on your high school education, you might prefer a diploma program because it can be an opportunity to explore new subjects and skills that you won’t learn in a GED program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2791" id="footnote-ref-2791">[2790]</a></sup> <strong>WARNING: Watch out for scam programs, which will try to charge you money for a fake diploma. See PG. 853 for details.</strong></p>
