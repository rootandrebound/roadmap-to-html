        <h1>I think my traffic ticket qualifies for dismissal. How can I get it dismissed?</h1>
        <p class="text">You must proactively request dismissal from the DMV directly. The court will not automatically do this on your behalf. You will need to send a letter to the DMV on official California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation letterhead, and get it signed by an “Authorized Representative.” </p>
        <ol class="text"><em>If you’re currently incarcerated</em>,<em> </em>you should ask your Correctional Counselor or other prison staff person to provide letterhead and sign off on your request. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>If you’re formerly incarcerated and on some form of community supervision like probation or parole</em>, you will have to ask your parole or probation officer to provide letterhead and sign off on your request.<sup><a href="#footnote-2229" id="footnote-ref-2229">[2228]</a></sup> </ol>
        <p class="text">The letter should say that you are requesting dismissal of your misdemeanor or infraction ticket under Vehicle Code Section 41500, and it must include the dates of your commitment and release (if you’re out). Send your request to: </p>
        <p class="text">Department of Motor Vehicles, Division of Drivers Safety and Licensing<br/>P.O. Box 9412890<br/>Sacramento, CA 94290</p>
        <p class="text">A DMV employee will then review your request to decide if your ticket qualifies for dismissal. </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTHere are 3 options if you are struggling to pay your traffic fines:</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Payment Plans—If you owe unpaid traffic fines, you can contact the court, parking authority, or collection agency that you owe money to and ask about setting up a <em>payment or installment plan </em>(where you pay off a little every month instead of everything all at once). Amnesty Programs—California now has a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people reduce the amount of traffic debt owed and in some cases, reinstate a suspended driver license.<sup><a href="#footnote-2230" id="footnote-ref-2230">[2229]</a></sup> Contact the traffic court in the county where you owe money for more information about the program.Specialty Courts—Some counties have special <em>homeless courts, DUI courts, or other community courts</em> that may be able to help you resolve your tickets and fines. Contact the local public defender in the county where you got the ticket to ask if there are any community courts available and whether you are eligible. What if I owe court-ordered debt for a federal offense?</p>
        <p class="text">Up to this point, this Chapter has <em>only</em> covered debts that were ordered by a <em>California state court</em>, NOT those ordered by a federal court. </p>
        <p class="text">If you have debts that stem from a <em>federal</em> offense, your court-ordered debt will look different, because federal courts have their own rules for restitution, fines, and fees. However, these 3 general <em>types</em> of debt are the same in the federal system:</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>Restitution</em>: <em>Repays any victims</em> (people, organizations, government agencies, etc.) that suffered harm, property damage, or monetary losses caused by your actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2231" id="footnote-ref-2231">[2230]</a></sup> This is like <em>victim restitution</em> in state court.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Fines</em>: Serve as additional <em>punishment</em> for your offense and are part of your criminal sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2232" id="footnote-ref-2232">[2231]</a></sup> The amount of the fine will depend on the crime for which you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-2233" id="footnote-ref-2233">[2232]</a></sup> These are like <em>fines and penalties</em> in state court<em>.</em></ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Special Assessments</em>: Fees assigned for each separate offense you were convicted of. The amount of the Assessment depends on the seriousness of the offense. <em>ALL of your federal Special Assessment debt will be forgiven 5 years after your conviction, after which you will no longer owe this debt</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2234" id="footnote-ref-2234">[2233]</a></sup> </ol>
        <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just like for state court debt, you may also owe additional interest or other penalties on your federal court-ordered debt (for example, if you don’t make required payments on time).</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">For more information on federal court-ordered debt</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">If you have questions about your federal court-ordered debt, you should contact your federal public defender or the federal public defender office in your area.To find out how much you owe, contact the federal district court where you were convicted. You will need to speak with the Finance Department to find out your balance. To find out if you owe additional interest or penalties, you will need to contact the U.S. Attorney’s Financial Litigation (Collections) Unit to learn about these additional amounts.Your federal probation officer may also be able to answer questions about your court-ordered debt, such as how much you owe and/or how to make payments.</ul>
        <h2><a id="_Toc352861790"></a><a id="COD_TakingControl_Intro"></a>TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT</h2>
        <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">How to take control of your court-ordered debt, including:How find out how much you owe; How to get your debt reduced or forgiven; andStrategies for managing and paying off your debt.</ul>
        <p class="text">Taking control of your court-ordered debt is done by knowing the type of debt you owe, the amount of debt you owe, and creating plan as to how to repay this debt based on how it will impact on your parole/probation term and employment. In Part III, we will answer the following questions for each type of debt:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">REQUESTING copies of your ORIGINAL SENTENCING ORDERS</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you want to see what amounts you were originally ordered to pay, you can request a copy of your sentencing order from the court that sentenced you. HOWEVER, these amounts are the <em>original</em> amounts ordered by the court, and will NOT reflect any payments that you’ve made OR include any interest or fees that have been added since. The order also will NOT show the debts you owe from ANY other cases.</p>
