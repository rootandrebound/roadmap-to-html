        <h4 class="textbox">WARNING: Read carefully</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In the chart above, we summarize 4 situations where a Public Housing Authority (PHA) and the owners of federal government-assisted housing MUST reject you under law based on particular types of convictions. PLEASE NOTE: </p>
        <ul class="textbox">These required (“mandatory”) bans apply only to SOME types of federal government-assisted housing, but not ALL types. There are government-assisted housing programs where these bans <em>do not apply</em>.Also, some of these required bans will last for the rest of your life, but others are only temporary bans.Refer back to <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_355">PG. 355</a> for an overview of required vs. allowed bans.</ul>
        <p class="textbox">SO READ CAREFULLY!<strong> </strong>Don’t assume the ban applies to you. Try to match your exact situation and conviction/criminal record with this chart to see how your criminal record will impact your ability to get into federal government-assisted housing.<strong> </strong></p>
