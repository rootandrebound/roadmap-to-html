        <h1>How much time do I have to file a discrimination complaint against an employer?</h1>
        <p class="text">In California, you only have 300 days (10 months) to report employment discrimination to the EEOC, or 1 year to report discrimination to the DFEH.<sup><a href="#footnote-1966" id="footnote-ref-1966">[1965]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">How to File a Complaint with the federal EEOC:</h4>
        <p class="textbox">If you decide to file a claim, you can contact the EEOC in person or by mail to report the employment discrimination and file a complaint.</p>
        <ul class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">In person:</span> The EEOC has local offices in the following California cities: Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. Contact the local EEOC office near you to report discrimination and file a complaint. (See Appendix L, PG. 633 for local EEOC office addresses and phone numbers.) You can also call 1-800-669-4000 to give basic information about your situation, and then a local office will follow up with you about filing a complaint. (Important: You cannot actually file an EEOC complaint by phone, but you can get the process started.)<span class="emphasisitalic">By Mail:</span> You can mail a written complaint to any local EEOC office. For instructions on how to write a complaint, see PG. 590, below. For a list of local EEOC offices and addresses, see Appendix L, PG. 633. </ul>
        <h4 class="textbox">How to File a Complaint with the California DFEH:</h4>
        <p class="textbox">You can contact the DFEH by mail, by phone, or online to report the discrimination and file a “Pre-Complaint Inquiry”:</p>
        <ul class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">By Mail:</span> Fill out the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form and mail it to any local DFEH office. For a list of local DFEH offices and addresses, see Appendix M, PG. 634. To learn how to obtain the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form, see Appendix N, PG. 635. <sup><a href="#footnote-1967" id="footnote-ref-1967">[1966]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">By Phone:</span> Call the DFEH Communication Center at (800) 884-1684. If you have a hearing impairment, please call 800-884-1684 or TTY at (800) 700-2320 for service.<span class="emphasisitalic">Online:</span> Use the DFEH’s online system, available at <a href="http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/">http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/</a>, or email the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form to contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov.</ul>
        <p class="text"><strong>Once you file a complaint with the EEOC and/or the DFEH, you have two options:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">You can ask the EEOC or DFEH to investigate and resolve the discrimination claim, including filing a lawsuit in court on your behalf; OR</ol>
        <ol class="text">You can file a lawsuit directly in court on your own, but you must ask the EEOC or DFEH to give you a “Right to Sue” letter. (Note: You cannot go directly to court—the law requires you to go through the DFEH or EEOC first.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1968" id="footnote-ref-1968">[1967]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">For more information on how to file a complaint with the EEOC or the DFEH and a summary of the complaint process, see PG. 590 below. For a complete description of the EEOC and DFEH complaint processes, see Appendix O, PG. 636 (EEOC Complaint Process), and Appendix P, PG. 638 (DFEH Complaint Process). For more information about the process of filing a lawsuit in court, see PG. 593.</p>
        <h3><a id="EM_LegalRemedies_Discrimination"></a><a id="_Toc352861718"></a>What relief could I get if an employer illegally discriminated against me? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Limits On Compensatory &amp; Punitive Damages:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">There are limits on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages a person can recover. These limits depend on the size of the employer:</p>
        <ul class="sidebox">For employers with 15-100 employees, the limit is $50,000.For employers with 101-200 employees, the limit is $100,000.For employers with 201-500 employees, the limit is $200,000.For employers with more than 500 employees, the limit is $300,000.</ul>
        <p class="sidebox">42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3)</p>
        <p class="text">The types of remedies that might be available to you will depend upon what the employer did (the “discriminatory action”) and how it affected you. For example, if an employer refused to hire you for an illegally discriminatory reason, the remedy may include hiring you for the job or giving you any back pay or benefits that you would have received if you had been hired. If you filed a lawsuit in court, you may also get back any money you spent on attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and court costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1969" id="footnote-ref-1969">[1968]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">You also may be awarded “compensatory” or “punitive damages.” For intentional cases of discrimination based on a person's race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, disability, or genetic information, compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded. Note: punitive and compensatory damages are rare, and should never be expected.</p>
        <ol class="text">Compensatory damages repay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs of continuing with a job search) and compensate them for any emotional harm suffered because of the discrimination.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Punitive damages may be awarded to punish an employer who has committed an especially hateful or careless act of discrimination.</ol>
        <p class="text">In addition, the employer may be required to stop any discriminatory practices immediately and take steps to make sure not to discriminate again in the future. For example, if the employer had a blanket ban on hiring people with criminal records, they would have to change this policy and remove any language on the job application that says people with convictions will not be hired. </p>
        <li id="footnote-1966"><p> The EEOC usually requires discrimination complaints to be filed within 180 days from when the discrimination occurred. However, in California, you may have up to 300 days to file an EEOC complaint, because California law also covers the same types of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5 (general time limits on filing), 2000e-5(e) (time limits on filing where complainant has initially instituted proceedings with authorized state or local agency); see also Green v. Los Angeles Cnty. Superintendent of Sch., 883 F.2d 1472, 1473 (9th Cir. 1989); Saulsbury v. Wismer &amp; Becker, Inc., 644 F.2d 1251 (9th Cir. 1980). You must file a DFEH complaint within 1 year from when the discrimination occurred. Cal. Gov’t Code § 12960. <a href="#footnote-ref-1966">↑</a></p></li>
