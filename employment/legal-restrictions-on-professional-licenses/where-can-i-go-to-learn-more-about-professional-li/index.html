        <h2>ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT</h2>
        <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">Other ways of working and earning an income that are different from traditional employment, including:Self-employment or starting your own businessWhat an independent contractor is and how to become oneJoining a worker-run cooperative businessApplying through a temp agencyTaking short-term or temporary positions to get your foot in the doorWhere to look for more information about each of these options</ul>
        <p class="text">Throughout your job search, keep in mind that traditional employment is NOT your only option. There are many other ways of working and earning legitimate income—like starting your own business, joining a worker-run cooperative business, or going through a temp agency—and you may decide that one of these is better for you. </p>
        <p class="text">This section will explain some of the alternatives to traditional employment that you may want to consider:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Talk to a trusted person, or someone from a local reentry or workforce development program, for other ideas about alternative work opportunities that may be available.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153480"></a>Consider self-employment or start your own business </h2>
        <p class="text">Some people find it more fulfilling and empowering to be their own boss. Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibility within the workplace. It also gives you more legal and business responsibilities, such as managing money and product, paying taxes, marketing your business and supervising employees.</p>
        <p class="text">There are many resources available for people who want to start a business—good places to start are your local library, the Internet, or classes at a local community college or adult school. Also, many non-profit organizations and government agencies now offer assistance to people who want to start their own business. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, you’ll find a list of organizations and other resources for starting your own business in Appendix R, PG. 707.</p>
