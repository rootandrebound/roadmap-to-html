        <h1>Special Conditions of State Parole and Other Laws that Apply to Sex Offenders (“290 Registrants”)</h1>
        <p class="text">This section has important information about the legal requirements that apply to people who were convicted of sex offenses and must register as sex offenders under California Penal Code section 290 et seq. We refer to people who must register as sex offenders as “290 registrants” below. In California, some legal requirements apply to 290 registrants <strong><em>only while they are on state parole</em></strong>, and other rules apply to 290 registrants <strong><em>for the rest of their life</em></strong>, so please read carefully!</p>
        <p class="text">If you are a 290 registrant, there are five main types of special requirements that apply to you: (1) you must register with local law enforcement authorities, (2) you may be subject to GPS tracking while on parole (and possibly for life), (3) you may be restricted around where you can live (“residency requirements”), where you can go, and where you can be employed, (4) information about your identity, and in some cases where you live, may be disclosed to the public; and (5) the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) may place other special conditions of parole on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-455" id="footnote-ref-455">[454]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="subheading3">Registration Requirements</h4>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! If you are required to register as a sex offender, you have only 5 working days to register with the city police department (or sheriff’s department if there is no city police department) after you are released from custody or placed on probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-456" id="footnote-ref-456">[455]</a></sup>Read more about registration requirements in this section.</p>
        <li id="footnote-455"><p> The information for 290 registrants was adapted from an informational letter from the Prison Law Office, Information Regarding California’s Sex Offender Registration, Tracking, Residency And Public Notice Requirements (May 2015), available at <a href="http://prisonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SexOffender-Prop83May2015.pdf">http://prisonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SexOffender-Prop83May2015.pdf</a>.  <a href="#footnote-ref-455">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text">Here we discuss three situations in which you would be required to register as a sex offender in California:</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 1:</strong> You must register as a sex offender if you have ever been convicted of any crime listed in California Penal Code section 290(c). Cal. Penal Code section 290(c) includes a wide range of felony and misdemeanor offenses including forcible sex crimes against adults, most sex crimes involving children, prostitution and child pornography-related crimes, kidnap or assault for the purpose of committing a sex crime, soliciting another person to commit a sex offense, and attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the included crimes.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[456]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 2:</strong> You can also be required to register based on convictions for crimes that are not listed in § 290(c) if you committed the crime “as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.” <sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[457]</a></sup> This determination is made by the judge when you are convicted or sentenced for the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[458]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 3:</strong> Even if you were not convicted of a qualifying sex crime, you will be required to register if you meet any of the following criteria:</p>
            <ol class="text">You were adjudicated (found guilty) as a ward in juvenile court for certain sex offenses and committed to the CDCR Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) (formerly the California Youth Authority or CYA) or the equivalent agency in another state;<sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[459]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have been found <em>not guilty by reason of insanity</em> of any offense listed in Cal. Penal Code § 290(c);<sup><a href="#footnote-461" id="footnote-ref-461">[460]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have ever been found to be a Mentally Disordered Sex Offender (MDSO) or Sexually Violent Predator (SVP);<sup><a href="#footnote-462" id="footnote-ref-462">[461]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have been convicted in another state or in a federal or military court of an offense that has the same elements as one of the offenses listed in Cal. Penal Code § 290(c).<sup><a href="#footnote-463" id="footnote-ref-463">[462]</a></sup> Also, if you are required to register as a sex offender in another state, you are almost certainly required to register with California law enforcement when you are in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-464" id="footnote-ref-464">[463]</a></sup></ol>

            <li id="footnote-460"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.008. The list of juvenile offenses for which registration is required is shorter than that which applies to adults or juveniles tried as adults. Compare Cal. Penal Code § 290.008(c) with § 290(c) and § 290.006. See also In re Derrick B. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 535, 539- 540 (court does not have authority to require juvenile to register for offense not listed in registration statute applicable to juveniles, even if offense was committed for sexual gratification). Also, registration is not required if the juvenile was discharged from the CYA for the sex offense before January 1, 1986. Cal. Penal Code § 290.008(a). <a href="#footnote-ref-460">↑</a></p></li>

Even though the SVP determination process is civil and not criminal, it still triggers a registration requirement under Cal. Penal Code § 290 et seq. <em>See </em>Cal. Wel. &amp; Inst. Code § 6600. On the other hand, the MDSO designation allowed for people on state parole to be committed to state mental health institutions or outpatient programs. The MDSO law was repealed in 1982, but individuals who were in state hospitals and community programs at the date it was repealed are still subject to its provisions and are required to register under Section 290.) <em>See former</em> Cal. Wel. &amp; Inst. Code §§ 6300-6330 (repealed in 1982). <a href="#footnote-ref-462">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text">When you are sentenced for a sex offense, the court should inform you of your duty to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[464]</a></sup> If you pled guilty or no contest to a sex offense, you should also have been informed of any registration requirement before you entered your plea.<sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[465]</a></sup> In addition, when you are released from incarceration, the custody or supervision agency (that is, the parole or probation department) should inform you of your registration requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[466]</a></sup> For example, if you are in state prison, your correctional counselor and parole officer should go over the registration requirement as part of informing you about your conditions of parole (see PG. 157). See PG. 169 for a discussion of the limited situations in which you might be able to challenge a registration requirement.</p>
            <li id="footnote-465"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.017; but see Maciel v. Cate (9th Cir. 2013) 731 F.3d 928 (sex offender subject to mandatory registration requirement even though sentencing judge failed to include it in the oral and written sentencing orders). <a href="#footnote-ref-465">↑</a></p></li>
            <li id="footnote-466"><p> See People v. McClellan (1993) 6 Cal.4th 367, 379-381 (defendant may be allowed to withdraw guilty plea if he was not advised of mandatory registration requirement and would not have entered the plea if he had known of it); People v. Zaidi (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1470 (same); see also People v. Olea (1977) 59 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1298-1299 (discretionary registration requirement may not be imposed after no contest or guilty plea unless the possibility of registration was included in the plea agreement). Any challenge to the plea should be filed as soon as the defendant becomes aware of the registration requirement; otherwise, the challenge may be deemed to be untimely.

            <p class="text">If you live in another state, but you are employed in or doing business in California for more than <strong>14 days in a row</strong> or more than <strong>30 days in a year</strong>, OR if you are <strong>attending school full-time or part-time in California</strong>, you are required to register in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[467]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">If you are moving out of state, you must tell the local California authorities in the city or county that you are leaving; and the notification must be given <strong>in person</strong> and <strong>within 5 working days of your move</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[468]</a></sup> After that, you don’t need to keep registering in California, so long as you do not spend much time in California (but see the previous question if you work or go to school here).<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[469]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">However, you may need to register in your new state because the Federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires sex offenders to register with local authorities in each location in which they reside, are employed or are going to school. The SORNA registration requirements can last for between 10 years and life, depending on the nature of the sex crime and whether you have a clean record after being released from custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[470]</a></sup> It is a federal crime to live, work, or go to school in another state without complying with the SORNA requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-472" id="footnote-ref-472">[471]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">If you are required to register as a sex offender, here are the basic steps for <em>how </em>to register—including important information on <em>when</em> you have to do it:</p>
            <h4 class="step">Gather the information and documents you need to register.</h4>
            <p class="text">As soon as you can (perhaps a trusted loved one or advocate could even help while you are still incarcerated), you should gather all of the information and documents you will need to register. This includes:</p>
            <ol class="text">The address(es) of <em>all </em>of your current residence(s) <em>(see </em><strong>STEP 3</strong><em> for more information)</em>;<sup><a href="#footnote-473" id="footnote-ref-473">[472]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Proof of your residence location—such as an ID with your address, a recent rent or utility bill or receipt, or a bank or official document showing your address;<sup><a href="#footnote-474" id="footnote-ref-474">[473]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">The name and address of your employer; and</ol>
            <ol class="text">The license plate number of any car that you drive regularly.</ol>
            <h4 class="step">If possible, call ahead to the city police department (or sheriff’s department if your city does not have a police department) to verify <em>where and when</em> you can register.</h4>
            <p class="text">Some city police departments (or sheriff’s departments if your city has no police department) have special <strong>locations and hours</strong> when they register people. Calling ahead can help you avoid wasting time waiting around at the police station. If you cannot reach the city police by phone to verify hours and location, that is okay—just skip this step and go <strong><em>in person</em></strong>. </p>
            <h4 class="step">Within <em>5 days </em>of your release from custody or on to parole or probation, you must register in person with the city police department (or the sheriff’s department if there is no city police department) in every place that you live. Bring the information and documents <em>(see Step 1) </em>you need with you!</h4>
            <p class="text">You have <strong>5 working days</strong> after you are released from custody (prison or jail) or placed on supervision (parole or probation) to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-475" id="footnote-ref-475">[474]</a></sup> You must register <strong>in person</strong> with the <strong>police department</strong> in the city where you live, or with the <strong>sheriff’s department</strong> if you live in an unincorporated area or in a city that has no police department.<sup><a href="#footnote-476" id="footnote-ref-476">[475]</a></sup> If you live at more than one address, and your addresses are in different cities or counties, you must register with <em>multiple</em> police or sheriff’s departments so that you are registered in <em>all</em> locations.<sup><a href="#footnote-477" id="footnote-ref-477">[476]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="textbox"><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: The definition of “residence” here is broad and you can be “residing” at an address for registration purposes even if you are only spending the night there occasionally or staying there on a temporary basis.<em><sup><a href="#footnote-478" id="footnote-ref-478">[477]</a></sup></em></p>
            <p class="text">When you register, you will be required to provide <em>all</em> of your current residence addresses.<sup><a href="#footnote-479" id="footnote-ref-479">[478]</a></sup> Your fingerprints will be taken. You must also provide the name and address of your employer, the license plate number of any car that you drive regularly, and proof of your residence location, such as an ID with your address, a recent rent or utility bill or receipt, or a bank or official document showing your address.<sup><a href="#footnote-480" id="footnote-ref-480">[479]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Ask the police for proof of your registration. The police must provide you with a copy free of charge.</p>
            <h4 class="step">If you are a college student, employed by a college, or living on a college campus, you must also register with the campus police.<sup><a href="#footnote-481" id="footnote-ref-481">[480]</a></sup>Update your registration every year within 5 working days of your birthday—and more often if you fall into one of the special categories listed below.**</h4>
            <p class="text">Unless you fall into a special category listed below, you must <strong><em>re-register every year</em></strong>, within <strong><em>5 business days</em></strong><em> of </em><strong><em>your birthday</em></strong>, with the police department in the city where you live (or with the county sheriff’s department if your city is unincorporated or has no police department).<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-482" id="footnote-ref-482">[481]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>**SPECIAL CATEGORIES*** – People who Must Register More Often than Once Every Year:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text"><em>In addition to registering every year within 5 working days of your birthday, you must register more often if you fall into one of the following categories . . .</em></p>
            <ol class="text"><strong>If you are homeless</strong> (called “<strong>transient</strong>” by parole and the relevant laws), you are required to register <em>within 5 working days of release</em> from prison or jail, <em>at least every 30 days</em> after that, <em>and</em> <em>within 5 working days of your birthday every year</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-483" id="footnote-ref-483">[482]</a></sup></ol>

            <p class="text">In November 2012, California voters passed Proposition 35 (the CASE Act), which would require 290 registrants to turn over lists of all of their Internet identifiers and service providers to the law enforcement agencies with which they register (see definitions in footnote).<sup><a href="#footnote-495" id="footnote-ref-495">[494]</a></sup> Registrants would also have to give written notification within 24 hours of any change to their internet identifiers or service providers.<sup><a href="#footnote-496" id="footnote-ref-496">[495]</a></sup> The internet information must be updated as part of the annual registration process, and the registrant must sign statement acknowledging the requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-497" id="footnote-ref-497">[496]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text"><strong>Failure to register is a crime.</strong> If your underlying sex offense was a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication, then failure to register is usually a misdemeanor for the first offense, and a felony for any further violations. If your underlying sex offense conviction was a felony conviction, failure to register is usually a felony.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-504" id="footnote-ref-504">[503]</a></sup></strong> </p>
            <p class="text">There is no end to when you can be charged for failure to register since California courts consider it to be a continuing offense (in other words, there is no statute of limitations to charging someone with this as a crime).<sup><a href="#footnote-505" id="footnote-ref-505">[504]</a></sup> If you fail to register after moving to a new state, you could <em>also</em> be convicted of violating <strong><em>federal</em></strong> registration laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-506" id="footnote-ref-506">[505]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">You can be convicted of a separate offense for each requirement you violate. For example, you can be convicted of two crimes for failing to update your registration annually and failing to inform authorities of a change of address, even if both offenses happened during the same time period.<sup><a href="#footnote-507" id="footnote-ref-507">[506]</a></sup> However, there are rules that prevent California courts from imposing sentences for two or more registration crimes that stem from one single act. For example, if you move to a new county and do not notify the police or appropriate authorities in either the county you are leaving OR the county you are entering, you can be convicted of two crimes but can be punished for only one.<sup><a href="#footnote-508" id="footnote-ref-508">[507]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>The punishment for failure to register can be severe.</strong> Many of the crimes that require registration are violent or serious offenses, so a person who fails to register may face a doubled sentence under California’s “two strikes law” or even a life sentence under California’s “three strikes law.”<sup><a href="#footnote-509" id="footnote-ref-509">[508]</a></sup> Courts have upheld some third strike sentences for failure to register despite claims that those sentences were cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment.<sup><a href="#footnote-510" id="footnote-ref-510">[509]</a></sup> In a few cases, courts have overturned life sentences where the failure to register was a technical violation, such as not registering annually though staying at the same address.<sup><a href="#footnote-511" id="footnote-ref-511">[510]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">The interaction between criminal and immigration law is very complex, and the answer to this question depends on what your specific conviction is, and/or what happened when you took a plea in your criminal case.</p>
            <p class="text">A conviction of an offense that involves sexual or lewd intent can have a range of immigration consequences. But in some cases where the offense is less serious, careful pleading and effective advocacy mey help someone to avoid negative immigration consequences (like avoiding deportation). If you are unsure if your conviction will trigger immigration consequences, it is recommended that you reach out to your defense attorney/public defender’s office immediately about these concerns. </p>
            <p class="textbox"><strong>IMPORTANT RESOURCE:</strong> For general information on the immigration consequences of a conviction that creates a 290 registration requirement, the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC) offers a detailed guide online at: <a href="https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/10_sex_offenses_2014_final.pdf">https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/10_sex_offenses_2014_final.pdf</a>. </p>

            <p class="text">Under Proposition 83, which became effective on November 8, 2006, if you: (1) have been convicted of a felony that requires you to register as a sex offender, <strong>AND</strong> (2) were sentenced to prison, then the law says that you must wear a GPS tracking device (usually an ankle bracelet) during your parole, and for the rest of your life.<sup><a href="#footnote-517" id="footnote-ref-517">[516]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">The GPS requirement does <strong><em>not</em></strong> apply to persons who were convicted AND already paroled, given probation, or otherwise released from custody BEFORE November 8, 2006.<sup><a href="#footnote-518" id="footnote-ref-518">[517]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">However, there are other laws that allow parole authorities, the court, and the Board of Parole Hearings to require parolees to wear GPS tracking devices.<sup><a href="#footnote-519" id="footnote-ref-519">[518]</a></sup></p>
            <li id="footnote-517"><p> Penal Code § 3004(b); see also Penal Code § 3000.07(a). Also, please note that it is unclear whether the lifetime GPS rule is being enforced (it appears that it is not); and in an interesting development, the U.S. Supreme Court held that forcing a person to wear a GPS device for life constitutes a “search” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. The Court sent the case back to the state courts to rule on whether such a requirement is unreasonable. Grady v.

            <p class="text">It’s possible. CDCR can require you to pay to cover the cost of the GPS monitoring.<sup><a href="#footnote-521" id="footnote-ref-521">[520]</a></sup> But the CDCR can also waive (cancel) these fees if you are unable to pay, and <strong><em>must</em></strong> conside whether you owe any court-ordered fines, restitution, or other payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-522" id="footnote-ref-522">[521]</a></sup> If the GPS cost is unaffordable for you, ask for a waiver.</p>

            <p class="text">If you are on parole and do not comply with a GPS requirement, your parole can be revoked.
