            <p class="text">Formal probation is typically imposed for a term of 3–5 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-630" id="footnote-ref-630">[630]</a></sup> The length of your probation depends on what the court ordered, and that usually depends on what county you are being supervised in (since each county has some discretion to set the minimum length of formal probation within this range).<sup><a href="#footnote-631" id="footnote-ref-631">[631]</a></sup> </p>
            <li id="footnote-630"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 1203.1(a) provides: “The court, or judge thereof, in the order granting probation, may suspend the imposing or the execution of the sentence and may direct that the suspension may continue for a period of time not exceeding the maximum possible term of the sentence, except as hereinafter set forth, and upon those terms and conditions as it shall determine. The court, or judge thereof, in the order granting probation and as a condition thereof, may imprison the defendant in a county jail for a period not exceeding the maximum time fixed by law in the case. However, where the maximum possible term of the sentence is five years or less, then the period of suspension of imposition or execution of sentence may, in the discretion of the court, continue for not over five years.” <a href="#footnote-ref-630">↑</a></p></li>
            <li id="footnote-631"><p> Each county sets its own mandatory minimum. Alameda County, Alpine County, Inyo County, Placer County, Plumas County, Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, &amp; Tuolumne County require a minimum of 5 years on formal probation, while most counties in California only require a minimum of 3 years on formal probation.  <a href="#footnote-ref-631">↑</a></p></li>

            <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from your probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-632" id="footnote-ref-632">[632]</a></sup></sup> If you have completed all of the conditions of your probation (for example, paid all fines/fees, completed all counseling) and you are at least halfway through your probation term (for example, 1 ½ years through a 3-year probation term), you may be a good candidate to have your probation ended early. The process for terminating (ending) formal probation early is the same as the process for ending informal probation or Mandatory Supervision early. If your request (called a “Motion”) to end your formal probation early is granted by the judge, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion to Terminate Probation early, and also how to request dismissals of eligible convictions, please see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</p>
            <h3 class="subheading2"> <a id="_Toc448152889"></a>Conditions of Formal Probation</h3>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: It is important to know the conditions of your probation because, if you do not follow the terms and conditions of your formal probation, your probation could be revoked and you could:</p>
            <ul class="importantbox">Be sent to jail, or go to prison (where the court had earlier suspended a prison sentence by granting you formal probation);<sup><a href="#footnote-633" id="footnote-ref-633">[633]</a></sup> Be sentenced to the maximum sentence authorized for the crime you were convicted of;Have additional terms, such as public works service (“PWS” or “volunteer works”) or community service added to your probation;<sup><a href="#footnote-634" id="footnote-ref-634">[634]</a></sup>Have your probation revoked, and reinstated, for a new period of three-five years<sup><a href="#footnote-635" id="footnote-ref-635">[635]</a></sup> (see PG. 211 on probation revocation proceedings). </ul>
            <li id="footnote-632"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 1203.3(a). “The court may at any time when the ends of justice will be subserved thereby, and when the good conduct and reform of the person so held on probation shall warrant it, terminate the period of probation, and discharge the person so held.” <a href="#footnote-ref-632">↑</a></p></li>

            <p>There are some general/standard rules and conditions that apply to most (if not all) people on formal probation, BUT REMEMBER, EVERY COUNTY WILL HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND CONDITIONS. </p>
            <p><strong>Formal probation will often include some of the following rules/ conditions:</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-636" id="footnote-ref-636">[636]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Meeting with your probation officer as often as required, generally once a month;</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Payment of restitution, fines, and fees;<sup><a href="#footnote-637" id="footnote-ref-637">[637]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Participation in individual or group therapy;</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Mandatory drug testing, if you were convicted of certain drug-related crimes;</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Community service;</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">An agreement to submit to law enforcement searches of your person, residence, or property with or without a warrant (sometimes called a “search condition” or a “4<sup>th</sup> Waiver”);</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">No contact with victim(s) and following any stay away orders not to harass victim(s);</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Not associating with people who you know are gang members;<sup><a href="#footnote-638" id="footnote-ref-638">[638]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Agreement not to violate any laws.</p>

            <p class="text">Follow the outlined steps below to request a change (called a “modification”) in your probation terms: Start by contacting the Court Clerk at your local county superior court where you were convicted to ask if there is a local form. If not, you and your attorney will have to draft a motion. See Appendix Y, PG. 330 for more information. (Note: The process for requesting a change to informal probation conditions is the same as the process for requesting a change to formal probation conditions.)</p>
