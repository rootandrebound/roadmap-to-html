        <h1>Where will I see the length of my parole? And who calculates it?</h1>
        <p class="text">Your parole date will be listed on your CDCR Form 1515,<em> </em>“Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see example <strong>i</strong>n<strong> </strong>Appendix G<strong>, </strong>PG. 285). Parole will be responsible for calculating these dates based on state law, and your parole agent must tell you what they are.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152791"></a>If I am on state parole, what law sets the length of my parole? </h3>
        <p class="text">If you are on state parole, the length of your parole period is set by state law<sup><a href="#footnote-371" id="footnote-ref-371">[371]</a></sup> and is based on your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you are or were incarcerated for), and <em>when the commitment offense occurred</em>. The state law that is applied to determine your base parole period and maximum parole period is the law that was in existence <em>at the time of the commitment offense</em> (NOT the date you were sentenced on and NOT the date you were released onto parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-372" id="footnote-ref-372">[372]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-373" id="footnote-ref-373">[373]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum &amp; maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See PG. 154 for more information. </p>
        <p class="text">There are actually 3 discharge dates—a Controlling Discharge Date, Maximum Discharge Date, and Presumptive Discharge Date— that together determine when you actually get off parole, and a number of factors that interact with those 3 dates to determine when you’re eligible to get off parole earlier or later than originally expected. See the chart on PG. 154 below for a detailed description of these three dates and how they interact with each other.</p>
        <p class="text">You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms)—we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, PG. 281, for your reference. (The California Penal Code is a chapter of laws that apply to crimes, parole, and other criminal justice system-related laws in California). To look up the discharge dates that apply to you, see Appendix C, PG. 277 of this Chapter.</p>

You can only get off on your PDD if you have served parole continuously without disruptions, meaning no revocation/violation time, suspensions, or “dead time” for absconding (going missing or failing to report to your parole agent).</p><p>For example, someone might have a 5-year parole length with a Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD) of 3 years. This means that the person is eligible to be discharged after 3 continuous years on parole.</p><div class="textbox8">(NOTE: These parole length calculations are based on state law. There is a sample worksheet for how to calculate your parole discharge date in Appendix C, PG. 277 of this chapter)IMPORTANT! Some people do not have a PDD—meaning certain individuals do not have a date on which they are eligible to get off parole early.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-377" id="footnote-ref-377">[377]</a></sup></sup> This is based on what your commitment offense was and when it happened. Go to Appendix C, PG. 277 of this chapter to determine your PDD, if you have one.</div></td></tr></table>
        <p class="text">For an example of how you can calculate your own parole discharge date, see Appendix C, PG. 277. To determine your CDD, MDD, and PDD, see Appendix B, PG. 275.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In addition to these very important 3 dates, you can ask for your parole agent to recommend that you get off parole even earlier than your Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD), but this is very hard to do successfully. That’s because for your parole agent to recommend you get off even earlier, everyone has to agree—the parole agent has to support you; the agent’s supervisor has to agree; the Regional Administrator for your parole region must approve your request; and finally, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH), must approve your early release from parole.</p>
