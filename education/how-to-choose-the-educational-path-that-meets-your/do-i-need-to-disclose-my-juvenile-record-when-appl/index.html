        <h1>Do I need to disclose my juvenile record when applying to different educational programs?</h1>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Technically, a juvenile “adjudication” is not a criminal conviction. If your case was heard in a juvenile court, and you received a juvenile adjudication, then you were not “convicted” of a crime. So, if the application asks if you were “convicted of a crime” or if you have any “criminal convictions,” and you only have a juvenile adjudication, you can truthfully answer “no.” You do not have to disclose your juvenile adjudication.<sup><a href="#footnote-2715" id="footnote-ref-2715">[2714]</a></sup> However, some applications ask if you have ever been “arrested” or “adjudicated guilty,”<sup><a href="#footnote-2716" id="footnote-ref-2716">[2715]</a></sup> in which case, your juvenile arrest and adjudication count, and need to be reported. <em>Remember</em>, if you were tried as an adult, even if you were under 18, and you pleaded or were found guilty, then you do have a criminal conviction. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Even if you are not directly asked to disclose your juvenile record on an application, you may want to anyway. There is always a chance that the admissions committee will find out about a juvenile arrest or adjudication somehow, and think you were being dishonest in not reporting it.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2717" id="footnote-ref-2717">[2716]</a></sup></strong> HOWEVER,<span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>when you get your juvenile record sealed in California, <em>it’s as if it never existed</em>.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2718" id="footnote-ref-2718">[2717]</a></sup></strong> So, if you got your juvenile record sealed, you do not need to disclose anything in it. (For information on sealing your juvenile record, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 974.)</p>
