        <h1>How do I apply for SSI?</h1>
        <p class="text"><strong>You can apply by phone or in person</strong>:<sup><a href="#footnote-1723" id="footnote-ref-1723">[1722]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text"><em>By phone:</em> Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778). A representative will set an appointment for you to do your application by phone. This toll-free line is open Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 7 PM. For each time you call, record the date of your call and the name of the person who assists you. If you complete your application within 60 days of your first call to request information or materials, the SSA will treat that call as the date of your application.<sup><a href="#footnote-1724" id="footnote-ref-1724">[1723]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>In person:</em> First, call Social Security to find a local office near you; or, if you have Internet access, use the office locator at <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp">https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp</a>. Then call the local office to make an appointment. Unfortunately, you cannot apply for SSI online. </ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">TIPS For applying for SSI:</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">If you’re applying based on a disability, apply as soon as possible when you become disabled. The application review process can take 3-5 months.<sup><a href="#footnote-1725" id="footnote-ref-1725">[1724]</a></sup> Before you start, you may want to look over the Social Security Administration’s SSI brochure (available online at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-11000.pdf">http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-11000.pdf</a>) and/or disability application checklist (see Appendix H, PG. 523)<sup><a href="#footnote-1726" id="footnote-ref-1726">[1725]</a></sup> to know what you’ll need. If you need help with the application, call the Social Security Administration or visit a local Social Security office. You have a right to assistance from Social Security representatives if you need help due to a disability.<sup><a href="#footnote-1727" id="footnote-ref-1727">[1726]</a></sup> You have a right to appoint any individual—such as a friend, family member, attorney, social worker, or other trusted advocate—to act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the “Appointment of Representative” form in Appendix G, PG. 517.<sup><a href="#footnote-1728" id="footnote-ref-1728">[1727]</a></sup> Some counties offer assistance with representation or referral to legal services programs for representation.If you need benefits right away due to a financial emergency, ask if you can get “expedited” benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1729" id="footnote-ref-1729">[1728]</a></sup> </ul>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861620"></a>Can I apply for SSI while incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes! You can’t receive SSI benefits while incarcerated<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1730" id="footnote-ref-1730">[1729]</a></sup></sup>—but if you haven’t applied for SSI before, and you think you may qualify, you can start the application process as early as 90 days before your release date. Keep in mind that review of an SSI application can take 3-5 months.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1731" id="footnote-ref-1731">[1730]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">Some prisons and jails have a prerelease agreement with local Social Security offices. </p>
        <ol class="text"><em>If your facility has a pre-release agreement: </em>Speak to correctional staff. They may be available to help you complete and submit your SSI application before your release. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Correctional staff should also notify the Social Security office about your release date. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Ideally, if a prerelease agreement is in place, staff should start working with you several months before your release, and the Social Security office should then process your application promptly so that your benefits will start shortly after you get out. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staff:</em> Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to have application materials mailed to you and get help with them. Be prepared to give your release date. </ol>
        <ol class="text">If Social Security’s automated phone system doesn’t accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (“AR”) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix G, PG. 517 to appoint a family member as an AR). </ol>
        <ol class="text">An SSA representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.<sup><a href="#footnote-1732" id="footnote-ref-1732">[1731]</a></sup> </ol>
        <h3><a id="PB_SSI_WhatHappensToItWhileIncarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc352861621"></a>I was receiving SSI when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text"><em>It depends</em> on how long your incarceration period lasts—and, specifically, how many full <em>calendar</em> months you spend in prison or jail:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1733" id="footnote-ref-1733">[1732]</a></sup> </p>
        <ol class="text">If your incarceration doesn’t last a full calendar month: Your SSI benefits generally continue without interruption. Once you’ve spent a full calendar month in prison or jail, your SSI benefits get suspended (put on pause).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If your incarceration lasts for less than 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI benefits stay suspended, but you remain enrolled in SSI. This means once you’re released, Social Security can promptly restart your SSI benefits if it has proof that you’ve been released and proof that you still qualify based on income and resources. You won’t be required to show new proof of your disability—although you should promptly report any changes to your disabled condition. (For details on how to restart your SSI after release from incarceration, see PG. 486.)</ol>
        <ol class="text"><a id="PublicBenefits_SSI_Incarceration_more1yr"></a>If your incarceration lasts 1 year or more, and your SSI has been suspended for 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI gets terminated (officially ended). This means you’re no longer enrolled in SSI. If you want to get SSI after your release, you must file a brand new SSI application, including proof of your income and resources and proof of your disability. Processing your new SSI application may take 12-18 months. (For general information on how to start a new SSI application, see PG. 483. For details on how to apply for SSI while incarcerated, see PG. 486). </ol>
